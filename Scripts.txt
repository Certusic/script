[Open to Morty's room] <n> Rick: (stumbles in drunkenly, and turns on the lights) Morty! You gotta come on. Jus'... you gotta come with me. <n> Morty: (rubs his eyes) What, Rick? What's going on? <n> Rick: I got a surprise for you, Morty. <n> Morty: It's the middle of the night. What are you talking about? <n> Rick: (spills alcohol on Morty's bed) Come on, I got a surprise for you. (drags Morty by the ankle) Come on, hurry up. (pulls Morty out of his bed and into the hall) <n> Morty: Ow! Ow! You're tugging me too hard! <n> Rick: We gotta go, gotta get outta here, come on. Got a surprise for you Morty. <n> [Cut to Rick's ship] <n> Rick: (Rick drives through the night sky) What do you think of this... flying vehicle, Morty? I built it outta stuff I found in the garage. <n> Morty: Yeah, Rick... I-it's great. Is this the surprise? <n> Rick: Morty. I had to... I had to do it. I had— I had to— I had to make a bomb, Morty. I had to create a bomb. <n> Morty: What?! A bomb?! <n> Rick: We're gonna drop it down there just get a whole fresh start, Morty. Create a whole fresh start. <n> Morty: T-t-that's absolutely crazy! <n> Rick: Come on, Morty. Just take it easy, Morty. It's gonna be good. Right now, we're gonna go pick up your little friend Jessica. <n> Morty: Jessica? From my math class? <n> Rick: (puts an arm around Morty's shoulders) When I drop the bomb you know, I want you to have somebody, you know? I want you to have the thing. I'm gonna make it like a new Adam and Eve, and you're gonna be Adam. <n> Morty: Ohh... <n> Rick: And Jessica's gonna be Eve. <n> Morty: Whhhh-wha? <n> Rick: And so that's the surprise, Morty. <n> Morty: No, you can't! (shoves Rick away) Jessica doesn't even know I exist! But—but, but forget about that, because you can't blow up humanity! <n> Rick: I-I get what you're trying to say, Morty. Listen, I'm not... (spills alcohol down his shirt) You don't got... Y-you don't gotta worry about me trying to fool around with Jessica or mess around with Jessica or anything. I'm not that kind of guy, Morty. <n> Morty: What are you talking about, Rick? <n> Rick: You-you don't have to worry about me getting with Jessica or anything. Sh-sh-she— she, she, she's all for you, Morty. <n> Morty: I don't care about Jessica! Y-Yyyyyyyyyyou— <n> Rick: You know what, Morty? You're right. (throws empty bottle into the backseat) Let's forget the girl altogether. She, she's probably nothing but trouble, anyways. (presses a button) <n> Robot Voice: Arming neutrino bomb. <n> Morty: (unbuckles his seatbelt) That's it... that's it, Rick. I'm taking the wheel. (jumps up on Rick and starts fighting with him over control of the wheel) <n> Rick: Get off of me, Morty! (they begin to talk over each other) <n> Morty: I'm taking charge of this situation, buddy! (starts kicking Rick's face while grabbing the wheel) I'm put—I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm puttin'... I-I'm, I'm, I'm not gonna stand around like some sort of dumb... dumb person and just le-let you ruin the whole world! <n> Rick: (at the same time) Come on! What's gotten into you? If you love Earth so much why don't you marry it? (pushes Morty) What are you, crazy? Alright, alright, Morty. (pushes Morty off of him) <n> Rick: Alright. I'll-I'll land. I'll land. I'll land. I'll land the thing. I'll land the thing. Big tough guy all of a sudden. <n> [Cut to desert] <n> Rick: (Rick lands the cruiser in an open desert; he opens the door and tumbles out among dozens of empty alcohol cans and bottles) We'll park it right here, Morty. Right here on the side of the ree... road here. <n> Morty: Oh, thank god. <n> Rick: You know what? That was all a test, Morty. Just an elaborate test to make you more assertive. <n> Morty: It was? <n> Rick: Sure. Why not? I don't, I don't know. Y-you know what, Mo— (falls asleep and begins snoring) <n> Robot Voice: Neutrino bomb armed. <n> Morty: Um... <n> [Cut to opening theme] <n> [Open to Smith residence, dining room] <n> Jerry: I see there's a new episode of that singing show tonight. Who do you guys think is gonna be the best singer? (Morty falls asleep at the table, smashing his face into his plate) <n> Summer: Oh my God, his head is in his food. I'm going to puke. <n> Beth: Morty, are you getting sick? (Morty lifts his head, clearly exhausted, <n> and wipes food from his face) I told you not to practice-kiss the living room <n> pillow. The dog sleeps on it. <n> Morty: I wasn't kissing a pillow, mom. I just I didn't get a lot of sleep last night. Maybe my dreams were just too loud or something. <n> Summer: Or maybe you were out all night again with Grandpa Rick. <n> Jerry: What? <n> Beth: Dad? <n> Rick: What, so everyone's supposed to sleep every single night now? You realize that nighttime makes up half of all time? <n> Jerry: Damn it! <n> Beth: Jerry! <n> Jerry: Beth! <n> Summer: Oh my god, my parents are so loud, I want to die. <n> Rick: Mm, there is no God, Summer. You gotta rip that band-aid off now. You'll thank me later. <n> Jerry: (glaring at Rick) Okay, with all due respect, Rick— what am I talking about? What respect is due? How is my son supposed to pass his classes if you keep dragging him off for high-concept Sci-Fi rigamarole? <n> Rick: Listen, Jerry. I-I-I don't want to overstep my bounds or anything. It's your house. It's your world. You're a real Julius Caesar but I'll tell you something—tell you how I feel about school, Jerry. It's a waste of time. (Jerry stares incredulously at him) Buncha people running around, bumping into each other. G-guy up front says, "two plus two." The people in the back say, "four." Then the—then the bell rings, and they give you a carton of milk and a piece of paper that says you can go take a dump or something. I mean, it's not a place for smart people, Jerry. And I know that's not a popular opinion, but it's my two cents on the issue. (wipes his mouth and gets up, stopping behind Beth and putting a hand on her shoulder) This was a good breakfast, Beth. You really made the crap out of those eggs. I wish your mother was here to eat them. (Rick gives Beth a kiss and walks away) <n> Beth: (tears up in happiness) Oh, dad… <n> Jerry: What? For real? (Morty's face slams into his plate again) <n> [Cut to Ext. Harry Herpson High School] <n> Mr. Goldenfold: Alright, now, everybody get settled. Get away from the windows! <n> [Cut to Int. Mr. Goldenfold's class] <n> Mr. Goldenfold: Now, look, we're gonna be dealing with some real serious stuff today. You might have heard of it. It's called math? And without it, none of us would even exist, so let's jump right in. Two plus two. <n> All classmates except Morty: Four. (Morty, sitting in the back row, stares at Jessica, who sits in the front row, answering Jessica's name for the questions) <n> Morty: Jessica. <n> Mr. Goldenfold: Five plus five. <n> All classmates except Morty: Ten. <n> Morty: Jessica. (Jessica hears Morty and looks back, confused, not sure who's saying her name) <n> Mr. Goldenfold: Okay, good. It's time for the quiz. <n> Class: Awwwwww. <n> Mr. Goldenfold: Yeah, you know what?! Aw, too bad! Tough! First row, take one. Pass it back for me. The stakes are high in this room. (Morty stares at the quiz; the numbers on the quiz jumble together as Morty falls asleep) There's crucial things happening here every day. People getting smarter. Some of y'all getting dumber. Some of y'all ain't gonna see 3:00. (Morty falls into a dream world filled with large number-shaped blocks; Jessica steps out from behind some of the numbers) <n> Jessica: Hi, Morty. <n> Morty: Whoa! Hi, Jessica. <n> Jessica: Can I show these to you? (Jessica opens her shirt, showing Morty her breasts) <n> Morty: Wow. Th-they're both great. Thank you! <n> Jessica:  You know what I named these? My little Morties. <n> Morty: (rubs the back of his neck) Uh, that's flattering... and a little weird. <n> Jessica: Do you know what I want you to do with them? <n> Morty: Rename them? <n> Jessica: Squeeze them. Manhandle them. Give them the business. See if you can shuffle them. I mean, really get in there and knock them around. No wrong answers. <n> Morty: Wow. Well, okay, Jessica. L-let's give this a shot. (Morty grabs her breasts and starts fondling her) <n> Jessica: Mm. Oh, Morty. What are you doing to me? <n> Morty: Uh, I-I'm just doing my best. (in real life, class has ended and Morty is fondling Mr. Goldenfold) <n> Mr. Goldenfold: Morty! What are you doing to me?! <n> Morty: (sleep-talking) Ah, Jessica. <n> Mr. Goldenfold: Morty! <n> Morty: Jessica. <n> Mr. Goldenfold: Five more minutes of this, and I'm gonna get mad. (leans back and bites his lip) <n> Morty: Je-Jessica. Jessica. <n> Mr. Goldenfold: Not my fault this is happening. <n> [Cut to hallway] <n> Frank: (Morty is at his locker, where he is confronted by a bully, Frank Palicky) Well, well, well. <n> Morty: Uh, morning, Frank. <n> Frank: (pins Morty to his locker) "Morning"? What was what is that supposed to mean? You making fun of me? Are you trying to say my family's poor? (takes out a pocket knife and points it at Morty's neck) <n> Morty: Oh, geez, Frank. I don't know if a knife is necessary. I mean, you know, y-you kind of had things handled without it. <n> Frank: You telling me how to bully now? Big mistake, Morty and now I'm gonna cut you, 'cause my family's rich. (Frank suddenly freezes and Rick steps out from behind him) <n> Rick: There you are, Morty. Listen to me. I got an errand to run in a whole different dimension. I need an extra pair of hands. <n> Morty: Oh, geez, Rick. W-w-what'd you do to Frank? <n> Rick: It's pretty obvious, Morty. I froze him. Now listen I need your help, Morty. I mean, we got we got to get get the hell out of here and go take care of business. (burps) It's important. Come on, Morty. <n> Morty: I don't know, Rick. I can't leave school again. <n> Rick: Do you have any concept of how much higher the stakes get out there, Morty? What do you think I can just do it all by myself? Come on! <n> Morty: Aw, geez. Okay. I guess I can skip history. What about Frank? I mean, shouldn't you unfreeze him? <n> Rick: I'll do it later, Morty. He'll be fine. Let's go. (takes off with Morty and then Summer comes by, seeing Frank's frozen body) <n> Summer (in her head): Oh, my God. I'm about to walk past Frank Palicky. This is the story we'll be telling our children. (walks up to Frank and talks to him, oblivious to the fact that he's frozen) <n> Summer: Hi, Frank. (Frank's frozen foot breaks and he drops to the ground and shatters into a million pieces, dying) <n> Summer: AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH!!!!!!! <n> [Cut to horse hospital] <n> Beth: (performing heart surgery on a horse) Scalpel. <n> Davin: Scalpel. (Jerry enters the room) <n> Jerry: Knock, knock. <n> Beth: Jerry? <n> Jerry: My manager gave me an hour for lunch, and I thought, "hey, why not swing by where your wife works?" (The beeping from the medical equipment speeds up) <n> Tom: (offscreen) We're losing him. (Beth adjusts the horse's organs) <n> Tom: (offscreen) Okay, he's back. <n> Beth: Jerry, please tell me you're here for an incredibly urgent reason. <n> Jerry: Well, it's lunch. I mean, it's one of three meals that have existed for millennia. (the beeping speeds up again) <n> Tom: (offscreen) Losing him. (Beth adjusts the organs again) <n> Tom: (offscreen) Stabilized. <n> Beth: Okay, I only ask, Jerry, because, as you know, my job involves performing heart surgery. <n> Jerry: Well, yeah, on horses. <n> Beth: Excuse me? <n> Jerry: Okay, Let's not rehash that fight. I sense that you're busy and will now be on my way. (drops a pamphlet on the ground) <n> Jerry: Whoa! What is this on the floor? Some kind of literature for a really nice-looking nursing home. Hey, honey, crazy idea bad pitch let's put your dad here. Let's put your dad in a nursing home. (Beth looks at Jerry angrily and the equipment starts beeping faster again) <n> Tom: (offscreen) We're losing him. <n> Beth: Hey, Tom! We know when we're losing him. WE CAN HEAR THE BEEPS! <n> [Cut to alleyway] <n> Rick: There she is. All right. Come on, Morty. Let's go. <n> Morty: Oh, geez, okay. (Rick and Morty go through the portal and end up in a crazy alternate dimension) <n> Morty: Oh, man, Rick. What is this place? <n> Rick: It's Dimension 35-C, and it's got the perfect climate conditions for a special type of tree, Morty, called a Mega Tree, and there's fruit in those trees, and there's seeds in those fruits. I'm talking about Mega Seeds. They're they're incredibly powerful, and I need them to help me with my research, Morty. <n> Morty: Oh, man, Rick. I'm looking around this place, and I'm starting to work up some anxiety about this whole thing. <n> Rick: All right, all right, calm down. Listen to me, Morty. I know that new situations can be intimidating. You're looking around, and it's all scary and different, but, you know, m-meeting them head on, charging right into them like a bull that's how we grow as people. I'm no stranger to scary situations. I deal with them all the time. Now, if you just stick with me, Morty, we're gonna be— (a gigantic alien monster suddenly appears behind them) <n> Rick: HOLY CRAP, MORTY RUN!!! (they take off, running in complete and total fear as the monster chases them) <n> Rick: I never seen that thing before in my life. I don't even know what the hell it is! We got to get out of here, Morty! It's gonna kill us! We're gonna die! We're gonna die, Morty! <n> [Cut to black] <n> Rick: (having apparently escaped, they are walking through Dimension 35-C, continuing their adventure) Oh, Morty, take a deep breath. Breathe that breathe that fresh air in, Morty. Y-you smell that? That's the smell of adventure, Morty. That's that's the smell of-of-of-of a whole different evolutionary timeline. <n> Morty: All right, Rick, look how much longer is this gonna be? Shouldn't I be back at school by now? <n> Rick: Are you joking me? I mean, look at all the crazy crap surrounding us. Look at that thing right there. (a weird looking monster is seen cooing and rolling around on the ground) What the hell is that thing? You think you're gonna see that kind of thing at school? (offscreen) Look at it just lumbering around. (onscreen) It defies all logic, that thing. <n> Morty: Yeah, Rick, I get it. We're surrounded by monsters. That's kind of the reason why I want to leave. (they come up to a cliff and Rick stops him there) <n> Rick: Ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta. Morty, you see this? (he and Morty are looking down upon a vast forest of interdimensional trees) <n> Rick: You see what we just stumbled upon, Morty? Any idea what that is down there? <n> Morty: The mega trees? <n> Rick: That's right, Morty the mega trees with the mega fruit on them and that's what I'm talking about, Morty. That's where my seeds are. If we would have done what you wanted, I would have never have found them, because you're so in love with school. <n> Morty: All right, all right. So, what's so special about these seeds, anyways? <n> Rick: You ask a lot of questions, Morty. Not very charismatic. It makes you kind of an (burps) under- (burps) underfoot figure. (Rick gives Morty a pair of shoes and Morty proceeds to put them on) <n> Rick: Just take these shoes, Morty. They're (burps) special grappling shoes. When you're wearing these things, these babies, you can basically just walk on any surface you want, Morty up, down, below, turn around to the left. These things really bring it all together. <n> Morty: (walks off the cliff and plummets to the ground, screaming and smashing into rocks) AAAAAAAHHHH!!!!!! <n> Rick: You have to turn them on, Morty! The shoes have to be turned on! <n> [Cut to hospital] <n> Beth: I am not putting my father in a home! He just came back into my life, and you want to grab him and stuff him under a mattress like last month's Victoria's Secret? <n> Jerry: I told you I was ordering you something for Valentine's Day. More importantly, your father is a horrible influence on our son. <n> Davin: Everything cool in here, Beth? <n> Beth: It's fine, Davin. <n> Davin: Okay, cool. You know, we did something great today. There's nothing more noble and free than the heart of a horse. (Jerry closes the door on Davin) <n> Jerry: Since we're fighting, if you ever have an affair with that guy, I will come to the hotel room and blow my brains out all over your naked bodies. <n> Beth: Look, I appreciate the stress you're under, but Morty was having trouble in school way before my dad moved in, and the only influence I can see Rick having is that, for the first time in his life, Morty has a friend. (the phone starts ringing) <n> Jerry: (sighs) Well, maybe you're right. <n> Beth: Uh, yeah, maybe I am. I'm my father's daughter. I'm smart. Why do you think I'm a heart surgeon? <n> Jerry: (coughs) Ahem, Horse heart surgeon. (Beth answers the phone and gets a call from Morty's principal, Gene Vagina) <n> Principal Vagina: Hello? Mrs. Smith? This is Principal Vagina, no relation. I wonder if you and Morty's father might be able to have a chat with me this afternoon? <n> [Cut to Dimension 35-C] <n> Rick: (standing by Morty, who is lying on the ground with his legs broken) Morty, oh, you really d-did a number on (offscreen) your legs right now. You know, you got to turn (onscreen) the shoes on, Morty, for them to work. Yeah, look I turned mine on. I had no problem getting down here. It was a leisurely breeze. <n> Morty: I'm in a lot of pain, Rick! <n> Rick: Yeah, I can see that. But do you think you'll still be able to help me collect my seeds, Morty? <n> Morty: Are you kidding me?! That's it, Rick! That's the last straw! I can't believe this! I'm sitting here with both of my legs broken, and you're still asking me about getting those seeds?! Ooh! Ow! Oh! Y-y-you're a monster. Y-you're like Hitler, but-but even Hitler cared about Germany or something. <n> Rick: Okay, hold on just a second, Morty. (opens another portal and leaves Morty behind, lying on the ground to suffer for a few seconds) <n> Morty: Ooh! Ohh! Ooh! Hnngh! Hoo! Ooh! Ohh! Aaaaagh! Oooooh! (Rick finally returns and injects Morty's legs with medicine, healing them to perfection) <n> Morty: Ooh, Ohh, Ooh. Wow, Rick. That stuff just healed my broken legs instantly. I mean, I've never felt so good in my life. Thank you. <n> Rick: Don't worry about it, Morty. Just come help me get these seeds, all right, buddy? <n> Morty: Sure thing, Rick. (goes up the tree and gets the Mega Fruit while Rick talks to him) <n> Rick: Not that you asked, Morty, but what just happened there is I went into a future dimension with such advanced medicine that they had broken-leg serum at every corner drugstore. (offscreen) The stuff was all over the place, Morty. <n> Morty: Wow, that's pretty crazy, Rick. <n> Rick: There's just one problem, Morty one little hang-up. The dimension I visited was so advanced, that (burps) they had also halted the aging process, and everyone there was young, Morty, and they had been forever. I was the only old person there, Morty. (burps) It was like I was some sort of, you know, celebrity, walking around. I-I was fascinating to them. There were a lot of attractive women there, Morty, and they-they-they— they all wanted time with me. I had a lot of fun with a lot of young ladies, but I spent so much time there, my interdimensional portal device it's got no charge left, Morty. It's got no charge left. <n> Morty: What?! <n> Rick: It's as good as garbage, Morty. It's not gonna work anymore, Morty. <n> Morty: Oh, geez, Rick, that's not good. W-what are we gonna do? I-I have to be back at school right now. How are we gonna get back home? <n> Rick: There's ways to get back home, Morty. It's just it's just gonna be a little bit of a hassle. We're gonna have to go through interdimensional customs, so you're gonna have to do me a real solid. <n> Morty: Uh-oh. <n> Rick: When we get to customs, I'm gonna need you to take these seeds into the bathroom, and I'm gonna need you to put them way up inside your butthole, Morty. <n> Morty: In my butt? <n> Rick: Put them way up inside there, as far as they can fit. <n> Morty: Oh, geez, Rick. I really don't want to have to do that. <n> Rick: Well, somebody's got to do it, Morty. Th-these seeds aren't gonna get through customs unless they're in someone's rectum, Morty <n> Morty: Uuuh. <n> Rick: And they'll fall right out of mine. I've done this too many times, Morty. I mean, you're young. Y-y-you've got your whole life ahead of you, and your anal cavity is still taut, yet malleable. You got to do it for grandpa, Morty. Y- (burps) you've got to put these seeds inside your butt. <n> Morty: In my butt? <n> Rick: Come on, Morty. Please, Morty. You have to do it, Morty. <n> Morty: Oh, man. <n> [Cut to high school] <n> Principal Vagina: The fact is, your son, Morty, has attended this school for a total of seven hours over the last two months. <n> Beth: What? Why didn't you notify us? <n> Principal Vagina: I done been notifying you. Have you not been getting the messages I've been leaving with Morty's grandfather? <n> Jerry: Boom! Told you! In your face! He is ruining our child! Wait, what am I celebrating? <n> Principal Vagina: Yeah, see, I thought something was fishy there, because it's usually Morty's grandpa that's taking him out of school. (they stop to see Summer and some other students, crying at an obituary for Frank) <n> Beth: Summer? <n> Summer: (sobs) What kind of God lets this happen? <n> Principal Vagina: We had a little incident. A student was frozen to death. (chuckles) And there's no evidence that a Latino student did it! Everyone wants to take this to a racial place. I won't let them. <n> [Cut to Intergalactic Customs] <n> Announcer: The glarp zone is for flarping and unglarping only. <n> Alien: So, I told him, "give me the blimfarx," you know? This-this guy he doesn't understand interstellar currency. <n> Alien: It's, like, I'm trying to eat a flimflam like, that's what we eat on Girvonesk. <n> Announcer: The glarp zone is for flarping and unglarping only. <n> Rick: (Morty comes up to him, who is waiting in line to get through security) I don't like it here, Morty. I can't abide bureaucracy. I don't like being told where to go and what to do. I consider it a violation. Did you get those seeds all the way up your butt? <n> Morty: Yeah, Rick. Let's just get this over with, okay? I mean, these things are pointy. They hurt. <n> Rick: That means they're good ones. You're a good kid, Morty. Those mega seeds are super valuable to my work. You've been a huge help to me. I'm gonna be able to do a- <n> (burps) all kind of things with them. It's gonna be great, Morty. A- (burps) all kinds of science. (aliens are going through security with a Gromflomite, letting them through) <n> Gromflomite: Okay, next through. (stops Morty) Except you. You go over there. <n> Rick: Why does he have to go over there? <n> Gromflomite: Random check. He's got to go through the new machine. <n> Rick: What new- (burps) what new machine? <n> Gromflomite: It's a new machine. It detects stuff all the way up your butt. <n> Rick: Run, Morty! Run! (grabs Morty and they run through security and dart for the exit) <n> Morty: Aaaaaah! <n> Gromfomite: Red alert! (team of Gromflomites starts chasing after Rick and Morty) <n> Morty: Ohhhhh! (Rick pushes over a giant capsule, with an alien fetus over, smashing some Gromflomites, to slow them down) <n> Morty: Ohhhhhh! (an alien is seen smoking a hookah and Morty runs past him and accidentally inhales the smoke from the hookah while Rick comes from behind and slaps the alien in the face, causing the alien to cry; he then coughs up a life form from the smoke and the lifeform starts running through the glarp zone and goes through the entire aging process from developing fetus to decomposing corpse, over the course of three seconds) <n> Morty: Aaaaah! <n> Rick: Don't think about it! (he and Morty are cornered but Morty activates the grappling shoes and runs up the wall with Rick) <n> Rick: Ooh! Oh, nice, Morty! The student becomes the teacher. (the Gromflomites reveal that they can fly and then Rick and Morty start running away) <n> Morty: Whoooooo! (he and Rick run through the equipment on the ceiling, before they slip off to the ground) <n> Alien: Aah! Aw, hell, no, dawg. You know me I'm just trying to— (Rick and Morty crash to the ground and he dies; they then run to the portal computer) <n> Rick: I need to type in the coordinates to our home world, Morty. Cover me. (he tosses Morty a gun) <n> Morty: Oh, man. I mean, you know, I-I don't want to shoot nobody. <n> Rick: They're just robots, Morty! It's okay to shoot them! They're robots! (Morty shoots a Glenn, blowing his leg off, and making blood gush out as he drops down in pain) <n> Glenn: Aaaaah! My leg is shot off! <n> Other Gromflomite: Glenn's bleeding to death! Someone call his wife and children! <n> Morty: They're not robots, Rick! <n> Rick: It's a figure of speech, Morty. They're bureaucrats. I don't respect them. Just keep shooting, Morty. You have no idea what prison is like here! (Morty continues shooting the Gromflomites and even kills some innocent bystanders while Rick hacks into the portal to take them back home) <n> Morty: Holy crap! This is insane! (Rick opens the portal and takes Morty in with him) <n> Rick: Come on, Morty! We got to get the hell out of here! (the portal opens up in the lunchroom at school and Rick and Morty land on the table where Jessica and her friends are eating) <n> Jessica: Wow. Did you just come into the cafeteria through a portal? <n> Morty: Uh, yeah. Well, you know, my-my Ferrari's in the shop. (nervously laughs) Just kidding. <n> Jessica: You're Morty, right? <n> Morty: Yeah. (Rick grabs Morty and takes him way) <n> Rick: You can get his number later. Come on, Morty. We got to get out of here. You got to get those seeds out of your ass. (Rick and Morty are stopped by Jerry, Beth, and Principal Vagina) <n> Jerry: Oh, look, honey. It's our son with Albert Ein-douche. <n> Beth: What? <n> Jerry: I'm an angry father, not an improviser. <n> Rick: Oh, hi, Jerry. Oh, my goodness, Morty! What are you doing out of class? We talked about this. Your-your parents and I are very disappointed in-in this behavior... No? No takers? (Rick and Morty are back at home in the garage while Jerry and Beth start taking all his things and packing them up so he can move to the nursing home) <n> Rick: You guys should really not be touching that stuff. It's beyond your reasoning. <n> Jerry: You're beyond our reasoning! <n> Rick: Takes one to know one. <n> Beth: Dad, how could you make my son miss an entire semester of school? I mean, it's not like he's a hot girl. He can't just bail on his life and set up shop in someone else's. <n> Rick: What what are you guys doing with my stuff? <n> Beth: We're moving you to a nursing home. <n> Rick: A nursing home? What are what are you, nuts? I'm a genius. I build robots for fun. <n> Jerry: Well, now you can build baskets and watch Paul Newman movies on VHS and mentally scar the Boy Scouts every Christmas. <n> Beth: What does that mean? <n> Jerry: It's personal. <n> Morty: Dad, mom, come on. Rick just needed my help is all. <n> Jerry: Morty, stay out of this. You are obviously not capable of judging these situations on your own. <n> Rick: What are you trying to say about Morty? That he's stupid or something? <n> Beth: Oh, don't high-road us, dad. You know fully well that Morty is the last child that needs to be missing classes. <n> Rick: I-I-I don't know what you mean by that. Can can can you be a little bit more specific? <n> Jerry: Oh, for crying out—he's got some kind of disability or something. Is that what you want us to say? <n> Morty: I do? <n> Jerry: Well, duh doy, son. Look, I love you, Morty, but we both know you're not as fast as the other kids, and if you want to compete in this world, you got to work twice as hard. <n> Morty: Aw, geez, dad. Y-you know, that's a lot to drop on a kid all at once. <n> Rick: Morty, t-tell your parents the square root of pi. <n> Morty: Oh, come on, Rick. You know I can't. <n> Rick: The square root of Pi, Morty. Go! <n> Morty: 1.77245385... Whoa! <n> Beth: What the hell? <n> Jerry: (checks Morty's answer with calculator) Holy crap. He's right. <n> Rick: Morty, tell your parents the first law of Thermodynamics. <n> Morty: "The increment in the internal energy of a system is equal to the increment of heat supplied to the system." Wow! I'm so smart! <n> Jerry: But— <n> Rick: I told the both of you school is stupid. It's not how you learn things. Morty's a gifted child. He has a special mind. That's why he's my little helper. He's like me. He's gonna be doing great science stuff later in his life. He's too smart for school. He needs to keep hanging out and helping me. <n> Beth: Jerry, I don't want whatever's happening here to stop. <n> Jerry: No, I-I understand. Uh, maybe we overreacted. But he has to keep going to school. <n> Rick: Okay, Jerry. You drive a hard bargain, but what am I supposed to do? Say no? You-you really wear the pants around here. I just want you to know, between us, from now on, it's gonna be clear communication. (Summer butts in, crying over the death of Frank) <n> Summer: (crying) Frank Palicky was frozen to death today! <n> Rick: No idea what you're talking about. (Summer leaves, crying) <n> Jerry: Okay. Well, uh, Morty, it's your bedtime in an hour. Don't stay up all night again. This is good, though. This can work. I think we can be a family and now, Beth, if you'll have me, I would love to have you. <n> Beth: You know what? Okay. (she and Jerry leave) <n> Morty: Holy cow, Rick. I didn't know hanging out with you was making me smarter. <n> Rick: Full disclosure, Morty it's not. Temporary superintelligence is just a side effect of the mega seeds dissolving in your rectal cavity. <n> Morty: Aw, man. <n> Rick: Yeah, and once those seeds wear off, you're gonna lose most of your motor skills, and you're also gonna lose a significant amount of brain functionality for 72 hours, Morty. <n> Starting right about now. <n> Morty: Ohh, man. (losing consciousness) Oh, geez! Ohh. (drops to the ground and starts moaning as he has a seizure) <n> Rick: I'm sorry, Morty. It's a bummer. In reality, you're as dumb as they come and I needed those seeds real bad, and I had to give them up just to get your parents off my back, so now we're gonna have to go get more adventures. (excitedly looks down upon him, telling him about their future adventures) And then we're gonna go on even more adventures after that, Morty and you're gonna keep your mouth shut about it, Morty, because the world is full of idiots that don't understand what's important, and they'll tear us apart, Morty but if you stick with me, I'm gonna accomplish great things, Morty, and you're gonna be part of them, and together, we're gonna run around, Morty. We're gonna do all kinds of wonderful things, Morty. Just you and me, Morty. The outside world is our enemy, Morty. We're the only friends we've got, Morty. It's just Rick and Morty. Rick and Morty and their adventures, Morty. Rick and Morty forever and forever. Morty's things. Me and Rick and Morty running around, and Rick and Morty time. All day long, forever.

Summer? <n> Where were you guys this whole time? <n> Summer: On Gazorpazorp, <n> Where were you? <n> Beth: I was reading a newspaper, <n> Rick: Oh, that's interesting, <n> Beth, <n> You know, it's funny, <n> I-I-I heard about a little bit of news myself, <n> Take a look, <n> T-take a listen, <n> [ Farting ] <n> [ Both laugh ] <n> Wubba-lubba-dub-dubs! <n> This this world still got a -- it's still got a chance! <n> Yeah!

[Open Ext. Smith residence] <n> (Outside, there is snow on the ground. The Smith house is decorated for Christmas, and Jerry can be heard singing Last King Christmas.) <n> Jerry: *singing* Last King Christmas last arrived! <n> [Trans Int. Kitchen] <n> (The kitchen is a mess of food in various stages of preparation. Jerry pulls a ham out of the oven as he sings.) <n> Jerry: *singing* In the Christmas Christmas! *stops singing and smells the ham* Mmm… Jerry, you are really giving it to this ham. <n> (Jerry enters the living room, where a tree stands with presents underneath it. Beth and Morty are occupied on tablets while Summer uses her smartphone.) <n> Jerry: Um, Merry Christmas? *puts his hands on his hips* Helloooo? My parents are coming over for the first time in years! Can we stow the gadgets and look alive? <n> Beth: Alive? For your parents? <n> (Jerry snags her tablet away and stows it in a stocking.) <n> Jerry: Good one. <n> Beth: Hey man! <n> Jerry: You 'hey man'! This holiday is about humanity. <n> Morty: *not looking up from his tablet* You know, I thought it was about being born half-God or something. <n> Jerry: Okay, whatever. All electronic items are going in the stocking. Now. <n> Morty: *hands over his tablet* Ohhhh… <n> Summer: Dad, I'm not giving you my phone. <n> Jerry: Put it in the stocking, Summer, or I'm joining Facebook. <n> (Summer gasps and drops her phone in the stocking.) <n> Rick: *offscreen* Ho ho ho, everybody. <n> (Rick and Ruben enter the house and Jerry approaches them.) <n> Jerry: More like whoa whoa whoa. What is this? My parents are coming! <n> Rick: Calm down Jerry, this is Ruben, an old friend. <n> Ruben: Pearl Harbor. <n> Rick: I check in on him once a year and give him a little *burp* medical *burp* evaluation. <n> Beth: Aw, Dad… That is so sweet. <n> Jerry: *squinting suspiciously* Yeah, it is… I don't get it. <n> Ruben: Korea. <n> Rick: Don't worry about your C-C-Christmas, Jerry. *leads Ruben away* Ruben and I'll be in my workshop while you have another day in Phil Collins' proverbial paradise. <n> (Rick and Ruben head out to the garage.) <n> Jerry: Huh. You think you know a guy. (The doorbell rings.) Okay, there's my parents. Now remember, no TV, no phones, no laptops, we are connecting this Christmas, like old-school Jews on a Saturday. *opens the door* Hey hey! <n> (Leonard and Joyce walk in.) <n> Leonard: Merry Christmas, son. <n> (Jerry, not noticing Jacob, almost closes the door on him, then opens it back up.) <n> Jerry: Oh, hi. Can I help you? <n> Joyce: Jerry, this is Jacob. *takes Jacob by the arm* Didn't you get our text message? <n> Beth, Summer, and Morty: No. <n> Jacob: You must be Jerry! That's a fine lookin' apron. William Sonoma? <n> Jerry: *smiling uncomfortably* I wish… But thank you. *closes the door* So… you're a…friend of the family…? <n> Leonard: *puts an arm around Jacob's shoulders* The way we see it, he's a part of the family. <n> Jerry: Wow! <n> Joyce: After your father's brush with cancer and losing your uncle, we looked at life and wondered how have we spent it? And how do we spend the rest of it? What are we going to be when we die? A list of fears and questions, or a collection of real experiences? <n> Beth: Holy crap, Joyce. That's amazing. <n> Leonard: Then Jacob came into our lives. We're learning to live again. <n> (Jacob puts his arms around Joyce and Leonard.) <n> Jacob: All three of us. <n> (Joyce, Leonard, and Jacob giggle. Jerry stares at them, confused and uncomfortable.) <n> Jerry: …Cool… Eggnog? <n> Jacob: Now we are talkin'! This man's got the apron and the eggnog, huh? <n> (All laugh. Rick enters and starts laughing with the rest.) <n> Rick: Hi Joyce, Leonard. *looks at Jacob* Hello there. <n> Jacob: Merry Christmas, man. <n> Rick: Morty! A moment of your time? <n> [Trans. Rick's garage] <n> (Ruben is in fits, laid out on a ping-pong table. He's naked besides a towel over his genitals and his Santa hat.) <n> Rick: He's in bad shape, Morty. <n> Morty: Aw geez, Rick! What did you do? <n> Rick: Gee, thanks Morty. What kind of monster do you think I am? I-I'm sittin' here trying to save the guy's life! (Rick straps a pack with a tube onto Morty's back and puts an earpiece on his head.) I want you to find Dr. Xenon Bloom. He'll know what's goin' on. <n> Morty: *extremely nervous* Uh… W-W-Where do I find Dr. Bloom? <n> Rick: In Ruben. *shoves a glass oxygen mask onto Morty's head* <n> Morty: Ruben… Minnesota? <n> Rick: Ruben on the table, Morty! *hooks up the backpack to the helmet* Look, I-I don't have time for you to wrap your little walnut around everything. *pulls a shrink ray into view and plugs it in* Hold your breath until the process is over or your lungs will collapse. <n> (Rick sets Morty under the shrink ray.) <n> Morty: W-What proc— <n> (Rick activates the shrink ray and Morty shrieks as he's shrunk down to a microscopic size. Rick picks up the container Morty shrank into and puts it into a syringe, which he stabs into Ruben's chest. Just then, Beth enters the garage.) <n> Beth: Hey Dad, where's Morty? <n> Rick: He's busy. <n> [Trans. Int. Ruben's body] <n> (Morty continues screaming as he is injected into the body in a stream of pink fluid. He lands on something soft and abruptly stops shouting.) <n> Rick (through Morty's earpiece): Morty, can you hear me? Head North! <n> Morty: Rick… Where am I? <n> [Trans. Garage] <n> Rick: *adjusts his own headset as he stands in the garage* Depending on my aim, you should be just south of the entrance. <n> Morty (through Rick's earpiece): The entrance to what? <n> Rick: Welcome, Morty. (The scene cuts back to Morty's view from inside Ruben.) Welcome… (Morty gasps.) …to Anatomy Park! <n> (The view pans to show an amusement park with a large Anatomy Park sign and various attractions and exhibits.) <n> Rick: It's a little business venture I've been cookin' up on the side with Dr. Bloom. (Morty enters the park.) An amusement park inside a human body. Science isn't cheap, Morty. This should really help put a dent in the overhead. <n> Morty: Oh my God! This is insane! Spleen Mountain? Bladder Falls? Pirates of the Pancreas? <n> Rick: You got a problem with that last one, Morty? <n> Morty: Huh? No, no, I'm just reading them out loud in the order I'm seeing them. <n> Rick: Okay, alright, if I sounded a little defensive, it's because Pirates of the Pancreas was my baby. <n> [Trans. Garage] <n> Rick: I-I got a lot of push-back when I pitched it, Morty. I guess I'm still a little defensive. Let's just find Dr. Bloom, alright? I-I'm picking up a distress signal in the liver, Morty. <n> [Trans. Anatomy Park.] <n> Rick: Proceed to the liver. <n> (Following a sign posting directions, Morty hurries off in the direction of the 'Haunted Liver,' taking a shuttle to 'Lower Abdomenland'.) <n> Automated voice: Arriving at 'Liver'. <n> Morty: *stumbles forward and hits his helmet on the window* Ow! <n> Automated voice: Mind the gap. <n> (Morty exits the train and enters a dark, unkempt area with flickering lights.) <n> Morty: It's really scary in here, Rick. <n> Rick: Liver's under maintenance. Ruben's seen some rough years, Morty. Don't judge. You don't agree to have a theme park built inside you if your life's going great. <n> [Trans. Int. Haunted Liver] <n> (Morty enters a haunted house-style attraction. An animatronic wolf suddenly springs up behind him.) <n> Morty: OOOOHHH! Rick, it's a monster! <n> Rick: No no, Morty. The only monster here is alco— *belch* —holism. (The wolf is mechanically pulled back into the wall.) That is an animatronic werewolf. <n> (A hand reaches from around the corner and a large, muscular man with a thick accent grips Morty by the throat, lifting him up and pinning him to the wall with his forearm.) <n> Poncho: Who are you? Answer me! Where did you come from? <n> Morty: Mmm! M-M-My-my-my Grandpa Rick sent me! <n> Dr. Bloom: Poncho! That's quite enough. <n> (Dr. Bloom walks into the room. He appears to be a blob of goo in a roughly human shape with glasses and a walking cane. Poncho glares, then reluctantly lets Morty fall to the ground.) <n> Dr. Bloom: Morty, that's Poncho. (Another man and a girl walk into the room.) This is Roger and Annie. <n> Morty: *staring sheepishly at Annie* Oh… <n> Dr. Bloom: And I am Dr. Xenon Bloom. <n> (A speaker apparatus emerges from Morty's helmet. Rick speaks through it.) <n> Rick: Hey Bloom, it's Rick. What the hell's goin' on here? <n> Dr. Bloom: I don't know why, but the entire security system has shut down. And I'm afraid the exhibits are unlocked. <n> (Rick's speaker retreats into Morty's helmet.) <n> Morty: Exhibits? <n> [Trans. Ext. Haunted Liver] <n> Dr. Bloom: Anatomy Park's greatest attraction, young man, isn't the music or the food or the Pirates of the Pancreas. <n> Rick: Watch it. <n> Dr. Bloom: It is first and foremost a living museum of humanity's most noble and ferocious diseases. <n> Morty: Diseases?! <n> (There's a distant roaring noise.) <n> Poncho: Hey Doc, I have news for ya. (Hepatitis A lumbers towards the group.) Your living museum is officially a wild safari! <n> (Poncho begins shooting at Hepatitis A.) <n> Roger: Hepatitis A! Run! <n> (The entire group screams and flees.) <n> [Trans. Dining room] <n> (The Smith family, sans Rick and Morty, are seated for dinner with Joyce, Leonard, and Jacob.) <n> Jacob: Oh… *leans over and wipes some food from Joyce's mouth with a napkin* The food goes in your mouth, girl! <n> (All laugh, but Jerry's laugh is forced.) <n> Jerry: Aha… I'm sorry Jacob, I guess I'm still confused about the precise nature and origin of your relationship with my parents. Are you like a—Are you like their caretaker? Is that what it is? <n> Joyce: We can go into detail later, son. <n> Leonard: Now wait, there, there's no point to secrecy. Let's all live and die honestly. Your mother and I have shared forty years of each other, mind, body, and soul. (Jerry and Jacob smile at each other, but when Jacob looks away, Jerry's smile becomes a glare.) And when minds and souls are joined for eternity, and when eternity is at the door, it's an invitation to let go of the body, and an opportunity to share and experiment. <n> Jerry: Dad, please, what are you saying? <n> Beth: Whatever it is, it's beautiful Leonard. *glares at Jerry* And we support you. <n> Jerry: Speak for yourself! Because it, heheh, it sounds like you're about to say Jacob is your lover. <n> Leonard: No no no no no no. (Jerry sighs in relief.) Jacob is your mother's lover. (Jerry again looks disturbed.) I watch them. Sometimes from a chair, sometimes from a closet. Almost always dressed as Superman. <n> (Joyce kisses Leonard's cheek and the two hold hands, looking at each other fondly.) <n> Jacob: Oh… *reaches across the table and puts a hand atop theirs* <n> (Summer and Beth smile. Jerry stares, at a loss for words.) <n> Jacob: Jerry, this ham's got to be all you, right? It's in-cred-i-ble. <n> Summer: *smirks* Happy human holiday, Dad. <n> (Jerry appears more despondent than ever.) <n> [Trans. Anatomy Park] <n> (Poncho continues shooting at Hepatitis A.) <n> Poncho: AHHHHHH! <n> (The whole group rushes through a door before entering a code and shutting it.) <n> Dr. Bloom: Hepatitis won't follow us into the respiratory system! <n> (They enter to a set of doors under a sign reading 'Alveoli Forest'. Roger examines a meter near the door.) <n> Roger: That's strange… *taps the meter* Air flow is down twenty percent. <n> Dr. Bloom: So the brain isn't getting enough oxygen. That's why security is offline. <n> Morty: W-Well, I guess we better check it out. <n> (The group passes through the doors. As the doors are closing, Alexander, dressed in a dog mascot costume, rushes up and passes through.) <n> Alexander: Hey, wait for me! *removes the head of his costume* <n> Dr. Bloom: *points his cane at Alexander* Put that back on! <n> (Alexander pauses a moment before putting the dog head back on. The whole group examines the area.) <n> Roger: If we got up to the bronchial catwalk, we could look for blockage. <n> Morty: *raises his hand* I'll go. *glances at Annie* Heheh… <n> (Morty jumps onto one of the bouncy, round alveoli and clings to it.) <n> Poncho: Don't be a hero, kid. <n> Morty: I'm not. I'm doin' it because it's fun. *he hops from frond to frond* <n> Poncho: *cocks his gun* We shouldn't be here. <n> Dr. Bloom: Whatever you do, don't fire that thing in here! We must save Ruben. This is my life's work. <n> (Annie touches a growth of bacteria on some tar, which squelches, causing her to gasp in fear and recoil.) <n> Annie: Ah! <n> Dr. Bloom: It's alright, my dear. Nearly all human lungs contain a strain of this bacteria, but the scar tissue… *prods it with his cane, seeing something has escaped from the scar tissue* …keeps them dormant. *looks up toward Morty, who is getting close to the catwalk* Morty! Get down! <n> Morty: Whoa! *grabs hold of the catwalk as a fluid drips down onto it* Whoa! <n> (Tuberculosis begins crawling towards him. He lets go of the catwalk and bounces back down to the group, pursued by the disease.) <n> Morty: Oh! What are those things?! <n> Dr. Bloom: Tuberculosis, coming in fast! <n> Poncho: *raises gun and starts shooting at the disease* Not faster than a bullet! Ahh! <n> Dr. Bloom: *grabs Poncho's arm* No! Do you know what you've done?! <n> [Trans. Garage] <n> (Ruben coughs.) <n> [Trans. Lungs] <n> (The force of the cough lifts the whole group off the ground, then they fall back down.) <n> Dr. Bloom: Get to the digestive tract! He's coughing! <n> (The group starts running.) <n> [Trans. Garage] <n> (Ruben coughs several times again.) <n> [Trans. Lungs] <n> (The group all manages to push through besides Alexander. Morty rushes back to help him as his dog mask is blown from his face. Morty grabs a frond and reaches for Alexander's hand.) <n> Alexander: Waaaah! Don't let me die! <n> [Trans. Garage] <n> (Rick looks down over Ruben's mouth.) <n> Rick: Just take a deep breath, Ruben. <n> (Ruben inhales deeply.) <n> [Trans. Lungs] <n> Morty: You're not gonna die! What's your name? <n> Alexander: My name is… *his hand slips from Morty's and he's coughed up* ALEXANDEEEEEEEER! <n> (Alexander's skin and soft tissue are peeled off as Ruben coughs into Rick's face, getting some spittle, including Alexander, on Rick's forehead.) <n> (The group, minus the now-dead Alexander, escape the respiratory system. Morty presses the speaker on his helmet.) <n> Morty: Rick! Ruben's got tuberculosis! <n> [Trans. Garage] <n> Rick: Oh, great work, Morty. *pulls a massive syringe form his lab coat* I'll just cure it, and then— <n> (Ruben's heart monitor flatlines. Rick tosses the syringe over his shoulder.) <n> Rick: Okay. Well I can't cure death. This is bad, Morty. You're trapped in a dead man. Listen, if the situation keeps darkening, do yourself a favor— <n> [Trans. Anatomy Park] <n> Rick: —and hop by Pirates of the Pancreas. Obviously I'm biased, but, I think it's great, Morty. <n> [Trans. Garage] <n> Rick: *sitting in a lounge chair, pulls out a flask* It's a bunch of pirates runnin' around a-a-a- pancreas. We don't whitewash it either, Morty. The pirates are really rapey. The top priority is to get you guys out of there, but I'm just saying, if that becomes impossible— <n> [Trans. Anatomy Park] <n> (The group listens to Rick, all looking glum.) <n> Rick: —please, you gotta treat yourself. <n> (The group is headed to the digestive tract.) <n> Morty: Geez, what's that horrible smell? <n> Dr. Bloom: You mean the Panda Express? *chuckles* Kidding, I-I'm kidding. (As he speaks, Poncho and Roger stock up on bottled water from the Panda Express.) The body is beginning to constrict and fill with gas. We're inside a corpse, my boy. Anatomy Park is doomed. <n> Morty: Forget about the park, Doctor! How do we get out?! <n> Dr. Bloom: The digestive tract is the evacuation route. Get it? There's an emergency station in the colon with a ray that can enlarge us all. <n> Morty: Everybody! Get to the colon! <n> Poncho: Now I'm takin' orders from a twelve-year-old boy?! <n> (As they walk, Dr. Bloom speaks privately with Morty.) <n> Dr. Bloom: Morty. The scar sacs containing the tuberculosis were sabotaged. This disaster was an inside job. Keep your eyes on Annie. She was written up several times by her manager at the churro stand. <n> Roger: Intestines are ahead to the left. Then the right. Then left. Et cetera. <n> (Morty slows to walk beside Annie.) <n> Morty: Hey, just so you know, I-I'm actually fourteen. So, you know… <n> Annie: What? <n> Morty: Not twelve. <n> Annie: Okay. <n> Morty: Because he just said I was twelve. <n> Annie: Oh. Good for you. <n> (She walks ahead of him.) <n> Rick (through speaker): Oh. Oh, Morty. Strike one. <n> Morty: *slumps forward* Nnn… <n> [Trans. Small intestine] <n> (The group travel down the small intestine in a raft, surrounded by animatronics singing 'It's a Small, Small Intestine.') <n> Animatronics: *singing* It's a road of laughter, a trail of food. It's a pathway that breaks up the fat in food. It's a tube in the chest and it sends out the rest. It's a small, small intestine! <n> Roger: It goes on like this for miles… <n> Dr. Bloom: *excitedly* And then we get to the large intestine! <n> (A low rumbling can be heard.) <n> Poncho: Shh. *shines flashlight* I hear something. <n> (Gonorrhea rises up from the river of waste.) <n> Dr. Bloom: *whispers* Don't move. Gonorrhea can't see us if we don't move. <n> (Gonorrhea roars viciously and moves towards them.) <n> Dr. Bloom: Wait! I was wrong! I was thinking of a T-rex. <n> (Poncho pulls out a gun, but before he can fire, Gonorrhea capsizes the boat and they all fall overboard. They swim to the 'shore' on the side of the intestine.) <n> Annie: We're sitting ducks! <n> Morty: Doc! Didn't you say the body was filling up with gas? <n> Dr. Bloom: Yes. Why? <n> Poncho: Kid! You're a genius! *pulls out a match* <n> Dr. Bloom: Are you mad?! <n> Morty: *grabs Annie's hand* Everybody! In here! <n> (They all rush into a cavity in the intestinal lining. Poncho lights the match.) <n> Poncho: Hey Gonorrhea! How's this for a burning sensation? <n> (He throws the match towards the disease, where it ignites the gas and causes an explosion. Gonorrhea falls down, dead. Annie hugs Morty, who laughs.) <n> [Trans. Smith family living room] <n> (Leonard, Summer, Joyce, Jacob, Beth, and Jerry sit in a semicircle on the carpet. Jerry scowls and slumps. Leonard is playing a set of bongos while Summer sings.) <n> Summer: *singing* Drummer, drum, drum, drum! Drummer, drum, drum drum drum, Christmas drums! <n> Leonard: Oh, Summer. Sing it! Haha. <n> Summer: Christmas drums being played by a boy! <n> (Beth is clapping along when she notices Jerry sulking. She puts an arm around him.) <n> Beth: Jerry, come on. This is what you wanted. <n> Jerry: I get it, Beth. Be careful what you wish for. I'm being punished for taking your iPad. <n> Beth: What? Jerry, let that stuff go, okay? I'm sorry I was a bitch earlier. Let's just be here. <n> (Ethan walks up to the sliding glass doors and lets himself into the house.) <n> Ethan: Ugh… Summer! <n> Summer: *stands up* Ethan, what are you doing here? <n> Ethan: I've been texting you for hours. What the hell?! <n> Summer: I don't have my phone! I'm doing a human holiday! <n> Ethan: Did you even consider how that might make me feel? <n> Summer: How you feel? Why is everything always happening to you?! <n> Jerry: *stands up* Summer, do you have a boyfriend? <n> Ethan: Yeah, do you, Summer? <n> Summer: I don't know Ethan, do I? <n> Jacob: *stands up and puts a hand on Ethan and Summer's shoulders* Jerry, no disrespect, but you really need to connect more with your family, man. <n> (Jerry stares at him, flabbergasted.) <n> [Trans. Anatomy Park] <n> (The group runs through another metal security door and hurry down a platform to a growth ray.) <n> Roger: I should be able to access the backup generator to get the growth ray back online. If it works, we'll be regular-sized in a few minutes. I just hope Ruben's not in a room with white carpets or upholstery. <n> (Something roars in the distance, causing the area to rumble.) <n> Poncho: What the hell is that? <n> Dr. Bloom: The sphincter dam. We built it when Ruben became incontinent, but it was not designed to hold a corpse-load. <n> (The dam is clearly close to giving way. Roger keeps working to get the growth ray active.) <n> Roger: Almost got it. Everybody, move inside the circle! <n> (Morty notices a strange, black creature in Poncho's backpack.) <n> Morty: Poncho? What is this in your backpack? <n> (Poncho turns around to face Morty, giving Dr. Bloom a view of the creature.) <n> Dr. Bloom: That's bubonic plague! What are you doing with that, Poncho? <n> (Poncho grabs hold of Annie and holds a knife to her throat. Annie gasps and tries to kick free.) <n> Poncho: Everybody get back! <n> Dr. Bloom: Poncho, you son of a bitch! You released the tuberculosis so you could steal from me? <n> Poncho: *laughs* That's right, baby. A lot of people would pay top dollar to decimate the population. I'll take the highest bidder. Al Quaeda. North Korea. Republicans! Shriners! Balding men that work out! People on the Internet that are only turned on by cartoons of Japanese teenagers! Anything is better than working for you! *points the knife at Dr. Bloom* You pompous, negligent, iTunes Gift Card as a holiday bonus-giving— <n> Morty: AHHHHH!!! <n> (Morty leaps up and grabs onto Poncho's helmet, allowing Annie to escape. He punches Poncho repeatedly before Poncho pulls him off his face and throws him to the ground, where Roger helps him up. Poncho laughs evilly, but stops short when Bubonic Plague bites his shoulder.) <n> Poncho: Ah! Eh! Get! Get off! *he backs up and falls over the railing* Ahhhh! <n> (The four remaining look over the edge as he falls to his death. Just then, the sphincter dam begins groaning, almost giving way.) <n> Annie: You guys! <n> Roger: It's gonna burst! *urges the others on* Go! Go, go, go! *pulls a lever before trying to run after the others but catches his foot in some of the machinery* My foot is stuck! <n> (Morty holds Annie back as she makes to help Roger.) <n> Annie: No! <n> Roger: This is okay! It's okay, just go! Tell my family I love them! They may be hard to find because my wife kept her last name and she made the kids take it too, so, I dunno, you could goo— <n> (Just then, the dam bursts, drowning Roger in Ruben's excrement.) <n> Annie: No! <n> (Dr. Bloom seals the door to the chamber and Annie hugs Morty, distraught and crying.) <n> [Trans. Smith family living room] <n> (Leonard, Joyce, and Beth sit on the chair and sofa, Jerry and Summer stand, and Jacob kneels with Ethan in the center of the room.) <n> Jacob: Let me ask you something Ethan. Where's the anger coming from, man? <n> Ethan: From Summer being a total bitch! <n> (Jacob takes hold of Ethan's cheeks and forces him to make eye contact.) <n> Jacob: Where's the anger coming from? <n> Ethan: …My brother… took me fishing once…in the bushes… *voice begins choking up as tears fill his eyes* I can't… I can't! *covers his eyes as he starts to cry* He made me feel like a girl! *sobbing openly* I'm… m-made me a girl! <n> (Jacob helps Ethan up to his feet.) <n> Jacob: He didn't make you anything, man. You are who you are. *gestures to Summer* She is who she is. (Summer watches on with a sympathetic expression.) Now you go to her. Brand new. <n> (Ethan walks over to Summer.) <n> Ethan: Come here right now! <n> Summer: Oh my god, I'm so sorry Ethan! *they hug* I love you! <n> Ethan: I love you so much. <n> (The two begin making out. Everyone claps besides Jerry.) <n> Jerry: Um… <n> Joyce: You did it again, cubby. Come here. <n> (Joyce and Jacob begin to kiss. Jerry looks to the easy chair to see Leonard has gotten up and is backing into the closet, unbuttoning his shirt to reveal a Superman costume underneath.) <n> Jerry: No! Stop! I hate this! <n> (Beth, Joyce, and Jacob glare at him.) <n> Joyce: Well, Christmas doesn't revolve around what you hate, son. <n> Jerry: Well then, I hate Christmas! Enjoy being human! You guys are gross and lame. <n> (He walks out. Summer and Ethan and Joyce and Jacob continue kissing.) <n> [Trans. Anatomy Park] <n> (The three survivors are in a small theater where an animatronic Ruben gives a presentation. Morty and Annie have their helmets off and are making out, and Dr. Bloom sits a few seats away eating ice cream.) <n> Animatronic Ruben: My name's Ruben Ridley. You're inside me right now, but by the end of this journey, I'll be inside all of you. <n> (Dr. Bloom appears to miss every other bite of ice cream, probably due to his semi-aqueous form.) <n> Animatronic Ruben: My story begins in the dot com crash in the early '90s. <n> (The animatronic sparks, then goes limp.) <n> Annie: *whispering to Morty* You can put your fingers wherever you want… <n> Rick (through speaker): Morty, you wanna put it on mute or something? (Annie and Morty both look at Morty's helmet, startled.) <n> [Trans. Garage] <n> (Rick is working on a computer, still talking to Morty through his headset.) <n> Rick: I'm trying to concentrate. <n> (Jerry wanders to the door.) <n> Jerry: Ah, Rick? <n> Rick: *holds up a hand without even looking over at him* Not now, Jerry. I've got much, much smaller fish to fry. <n> Jerry: *enters anyway* I wanted to say I'm sorry I ever judged you. *leans on the ping pong table, looking down at Ruben's corpse* Right now, you're my sanest relative. <n> (Rick, who had been typing away, suddenly pauses.) <n> Rick: Relative… That's it! Relative size! Jerry, hand me a scalpel and a bundle of dynamite! *into his headset* Morty! Can you get to the left nipple? <n> [Trans. Anatomy Park] <n> (Annie is in Morty's lap.) <n> Morty: Are you kidding? I'm hoping I can get to both of them, Rick. <n> Rick (through speaker): Morty, I'm talkin' about Ruben's left nipple! <n> (The area begins to rumble and cave in. Morty lifts Annie off his lap and both put on their helmets.) <n> Morty: We need to get to the left nipple! <n> Dr. Bloom: The body is decaying! (Bits of debris begin to fall from the 'ceiling'.) The arterial transit system is useless! We can try the service shuttle. It's connected to the skeletal system. That's why we call it the Bone Train. *to Annie* Would you like to ride the Bone Train, miss? <n> Annie: If it'll get us out of here. <n> Dr. Bloom: How about you, Morty? Would you like to ride the Bone Train? <n> Morty: Why are you doing this bit? We're gonna die. Let's go. <n> [Trans. Garage] <n> (Jerry looks on as Rick inserts a bundle of dynamite into an incision on Ruben's abdomen. He takes a few steps back toward the door back to the house.) <n> Jerry: Well, I can see that you're busy… Merry Christmas, Rick. <n> (Rick lifts Ruben's corpse from the table and heads out to the car, dumping Ruben's body inside.) <n> [Trans. Anatomy Park: the Bone Train] <n> Dr. Bloom: There's no autopilot. One of us will have to stay here and operate it manually. <n> (Morty and Annie glance at each other, then look back at Dr. Bloom. Dr. Bloom glances at each of the teenagers. Morty and Annie continue staring at him.) <n> Morty: …Uh, well… <n> Dr. Bloom: No, you're right. It was a dick move for me to even pause like that. This is all my fault. You go on. <n> (Something approaches the group from a nearby set of stairs.) <n> Annie: *points* What the hell is that? <n> Dr. Bloom: E. coli outbreak. Hurry! <n> (Morty and Annie jump into the shuttle as E. coli swarm the area. Dr. Bloom pulls a lever and the shuttle begins to move.) <n> Dr. Bloom: Oh wait, there is an autopilot. (E. coli surround him.) WAAAIT! ...OKAY, NEVER MIND, I WANTED TO SACRIFICE MYSELF ANYWAAAAAYYYY! <n> (As the train speeds down the track, some of the E. coli have attached themselves to the vehicle. One smashes the window of the train door and sticks its head inside.) <n> Annie: They're chewing through the doors! <n> Morty: Euuuugh! *grabs a fire extinguisher and beats the E. coli off the train with it* We're in the areola, Rick! Almost to the nipple! But we're also in a really bad situation! <n> [Trans. Earth's orbit] <n> (Rick flies his spacecraft out of Earth's atmosphere.) <n> Rick: I'm almost there, Morty! <n> (Rick lights the end of the dynamite bundle in Ruben's abdomen, kicks him out into space, and uses a growth ray to increase Ruben to an enormous size—large enough to make Morty and Annie their normal sizes again, but still inside him.) <n> [Trans. Earth] <n> (Various people across America stop what they're doing and look at the sky as Ruben's huge, naked corpse hovers overhead.) <n> Reporter: Reports are coming in from across the country about what appears to be a giant naked man over the continental United States. We now go to Tom Randolph in New York. Tom? <n> (As Tom speaks, Ruben's terrifyingly enormous face floats overhead.) <n> Tom: Well, his eyes aren't twinkling, and his dimples aren't merry, but I'm standing under a nose like a seventy-mile cherry! <n> Reporter: Thank you, Tom. Let's go now to Eric McMan in Los Angeles. <n> (Ruben's poorly kept toes hover in the background while Eric speaks.) <n> Eric: We've got feet here on the West Coast, Bill! Giant feet, even relative to the giant man's size! And you know what they say about that! <n> Reporter: Well, if the old adage is true, one can only wonder what is going down in the Rocky Mountains. <n> [Trans. Rocky Mountains] <n> (A lumberjack pauses while hacking down a tree, looks up, screams, and runs away.) <n> [Trans. Earth's orbit] <n> (Rick flies his ship toward the nipple.) <n> [Trans. Bone Train] <n> (E. coli continue trying to break in, with Morty beating them away with a fire extinguisher. Running up to the front of the train, he and Annie see that Hepatitis A is has damaged the track.) <n> Morty: Oh my god, the track! <n> Annie: It's Hepatitis A! <n> (As Morty tries to slow the train down, it flies off the track and straight through some of Ruben's soft tissue, bursting into the nipple. The train hits a bump, throwing Morty and Annie out. They look up and gasp.) <n> Annie: The nipple hole… <n> (Through the nipple hole, they're able to see Earth as the sun peeks over the horizon.) <n> Morty: It's beautiful… <n> (Suddenly, there's a crash behind them. Hepatitis A bursts out from the train wreckage and lumbers towards Morty and Annie.) <n> Annie: Aw no! <n> (The two run, and just as Hepatitis A is about to catch them, Hepatitis C snatches it up and shakes it like felled prey.) <n> Annie: Whoa! It's Hepatitis C! <n> (Hepatitis C gives them a thumbs-up before lumbering away with its kill in its mouth.) <n> Morty: Um… We… Did we have some sort of relationship with him? <n> Annie: I… think they're just like that? I think they're just good guys. <n> Morty: Oh. Huh. <n> (Rick flies his spaceship into the nipple, landing it behind them. Morty and Annie climb inside.) <n> Rick: Where's Dr. Bloom? <n> Morty: Sorry Rick… He's dead… <n> Rick: Goddamn it, Morty, I ask you to do one thing! <n> (Rick flies the spaceship out of the nipple and away from Ruben's corpse just before the dynamite ignites and the body explodes, sending blood and gore in all directions.) <n> [Trans. Smith residence] <n> (Joyce, Leonard, Jacob, Beth, Summer, and Ethan all bundle up to go sledding.) <n> Beth: Jerry doesn't know what he's missing. <n> Jacob: He'll come around, Beth. Christmas is a special time. It has funny ways of bringing families together. <n> Beth: I dunno, Jacob. Jerry got an invitation to be alive today, and he rejected it. I don't know if our marriage will— <n> (Beth stops talking as blood starts splattering the sliding glass doors. The whole group stares in shock as blood seems to pour from the sky.) <n> Summer: It's raining blood! <n> Jacob: Oh, shit. find Jerry! <n> Beth: Oh god. <n> [Trans. Jerry's den] <n> (Blood is raining on the window there as well. Jerry is sitting in a chair, watching the news, when the family bursts in.) <n> Beth: Jerry! <n> Jerry: *stands and hugs her* It's alright! The TV says there's nothing to worry about. <n> Reporter (on TV): The giant naked sky Santa has exploded. Blood and chunks of viscera are raining down on the country. Everything should be fine. <n> (Family sighs in relief.) <n> Summer: Dad, can I have my phone back? <n> Jerry: Sure, sweetie. *pulls out the stocking and gives Summer her phone, then gives Beth her tablet* Everybody, take a device. It'll help you relax. <n> Jacob: This is nice. <n> Jerry: Yeah. *puts an arm around Beth and Jacob* I guess we really learned something this Christmas, Jacob. <n> Summer: No we didn't, Dad. No we didn't. <n> [Trans. Smith house] <n> (It's no longer raining blood, but reddish chunks of Ruben are everywhere as Rick lands his spacecraft, parking it in the garage.) <n> Rick: Too bad about Dr. Bloom. *Rick, Annie, and Morty exit the car* He was a genius. The only man capable of creating a new Anatomy Park. <n> Annie: Actually, I studied Dr. Bloom's work. I believe I have the knowledge necessary to create a new, much safer park! <n> Rick: What about Pirates of the Pancreas…? <n> Annie: I think it was one of the most underrated attractions. <n> Rick: Booyah! Hold your breath! <n> (Annie is already standing under the shrink ray as Rick pulls the lever, shrinking her down to microscopic size once again, much to Morty's chagrin.) <n> Morty: Hey, wh-wh- What the hell, Rick? What the hell, man? I liked her! I really had somethin' going there, Rick! <n> (Rick pockets the container holding Annie.) <n> Rick: Yeah, so I heard. You dodged a bullet, Morty, trust me. *whispers* Puffy vagina. <n> Morty: W-What's wrong with that? That doesn't sound like a problem to me! I dunno! <n> Rick: C'mon. Let's get some stuffing, I'm starving. <n> [Trans. Smith family living room] <n> (Beth, Leonard, Summer, and Ethan sit on the couch, Jacob sits in the easy chair with Joyce in his lap, and Jerry sits on the carpet. All are staring at handheld electronics as Rick and Morty enter the room.) <n> Rick: Oh, unbelievable. We got a bunch of robot computer people sittin' around with their faces stuffed in computer screens. (No one acknowledges him.) Do you realize Christ was born today? Jesus Christ our Savior was born today! A-A-A-Are you people even human? What kind of Christmas is this? <n> (Jerry looks at the audience and shrugs.) <n> [End Credits roll] <n> [Trans. Rick's garage] <n> Annie (through speaker phone): Hey Rick! Rick, can you hear me? <n> Rick: Loud and clear, Annie. <n> Annie: Great! We're also on with Alejandro, our Chief Imaginarian— <n> Alejandro: Hey Rick. <n> Annie: Natalie Jacobs and Chris Desiter from Microscopic Marketing, Zach from Organ Concepts and Jamie from New Media. <n> Rick: Hey everybody. <n> All: Hey, hi Rick, how's it goin'. (etc.) <n> Annie: So. Pirates of the Pancreas. <n> Rick: Yeah, talk to me. <n> Alejandro: Hey Rick, it's Alejandro speaking. Um, so we asked ourselves internally, we asked ourselves over here, "Okay, what does a pancreas do?" (Rick begins to look agitated.) And the answer was, does it make pirates? No. It makes insulin, you know? So we're starting with a new— <n> (Rick, furious, picks up and slams the phone, hanging up on the group call. Behind him, Ethan lies on a table.) <n> Ethan: So those guys are inside me, huh? Like, building a park? <n> Rick: Those guys are inside you building a piece of shit, Ethan! They're inside you building a monument to compromise! Fuck 'em. Fuck those people. Fuck this whole thing, Ethan. <n> Ethan: … Cool. And who pays me? <n> [END]

Boy, sure is really especially beautiful out there today, huh? <n> Rick: Oh, yes, Morty. It's almost unbelievable, isn't it? <n> Morty: Yeah, you know? There's something about the air. And just the way the sunshine is. <n> Rick: Oh, sure, buddy. Yeah. Sure. B-brilliant. Very convincing. <n> Morty: Wh… convincing? <n> Rick: Oh! Responsive, too! In real time! I love it! <n> Morty: Uhhokay. <n> Beth: *robotic* I'm going to work. Morty, good morning. Dad, good morning. I am going to work. Goodbye. (Beth drives away.) <n> Morty: What's with Mom? <n> Rick: Oh, what's with Mom? So, you're saying that she's acting weird? How soph—*burp*—isticated. Careful, guys. You're gonna burn out the CPU with this one. <n> Morty: Okay, you know what, Rick? You're acting weird, too. <n> Rick: Whatever, quote-unquote "Morty." <n> Morty: Alright, well I'll see you after school. (Walks into the side of the garage.) Ow! Oof! Ugh! Damn it! I'm all right. I'm okay. <n> [Trans. Morty's math class] <n> Mr. Goldenfold: Alright, who can tell me what 5 x 9 is? (Students whisper.) Morty? <n> Morty: Uh, me? <n> Mr. Goldenfold: What is 5 x 9? <n> Morty: Um, you know, it's, uh, at least 40. <n> (Students gasp.) <n> Mr. Goldenfold: Morty, that's exactly correct! 5 x 9 is at least 40! Come up here. <n> (Students cheer.) <n> Jessica: Whoo! Way to go, Morty! <n> Mr. Goldenfold: Everybody, this is the best student. I want you to be the teacher today. *sits down at a desk* Teach us, Morty! <n> Rick: *spying from outside* Interesting… <n> Morty: W-w-w-what do you want me to teach you? <n> Student: Ooh, ooh! How do you make concentrated dark matter? <n> Mr. Goldenfold: Oh, that's a good question. <n> Morty: Concentrated huh? <n> Mr. Goldenfold: Concentrated dark matter. The fuel for accelerated space travel. Now, do you know how to make it? <n> Morty: Uhhh… <n> Jessica: Come on, Morty. Isn't your grandpa, like, a scientist? <n> Morty: Oh, yeah, but, you know, he told me that I shouldn't go around spouting off about, you know, his science and stuff. <n> Jessica: I bet you've seen him make concentrated dark matter a lot. You know, if you tell us, I'll be your girlfriend. <n> Morty: Uh, y-you will? <n> Mr. Goldenfold: Seems like a rare opportunity, Morty. <n> Rick: *kicks open the door* Morty, u-uh, come on. There's a family emergency. <n> (Rick grabs Morty by one arm. Mr. Goldenfold grabs the other.) <n> Mr. Goldenfold: Stop right there! If he leaves, I'm giving him an F! <n> Rick: He doesn't care. <n> Morty: Aw, man! (Rick drags him to the locker room.) Rick, I have to go back! I think I was about to get married! *falls down* Ugh! <n> Rick: Take a shower with me, Morty. <n> Morty: What?! <n> Rick: Listen to me, Morty. Get your clothes off and get in the shower right now. *strips* Y-y-y-you got to trust me, Morty. <n> Morty: Ugh! I'm gonna get an F in class, Rick. *strips* <n> Rick: Morty, that's not class. T-t-t-that wasn't your teacher. This isn't your school. This entire world is not the world. We're inside a huge simulation chamber on an alien spaceship. <n> Morty: Wait a minute. W-what are you talking about? <n> Rick: It's all fake *burps* Morty, all of it. Nanobotic renderings, a bunch of… crazy, fake nonsense, Morty. I couldn't say so until we got in the shower. They won't monitor us in here. <n> Morty: Monitor us?! *looks around and tries to cover himself* W-who?! <n> Rick: Zigerion scammers, Morty. The galaxy's most ambitious, least successful con artists. You know, it's lucky for us they're also really uncomfortable with nudity. <n> Morty: Aw, come on, Rick. If everyone's just gonna be insane today, at least let me be insane with Jessica. <n> Rick: I can't let you do that, Morty. <n> (Rick grabs Morty's clothes and they begin fighting over them.) <n> Morty: Give it to me! <n> Rick: No! You give it to me! <n> Morty: G-g-give it! <n> Rick: Morty, come on! Morty! <n> Morty: No, Rick! <n> [View of simulated world expands out to reveal they're in an enormous spacecraft.] <n> [Trans.

Ugh. <n> Prince Nebulon: Well, check every five quintons and tell me when they're not! <n> Zigerion 1: I think we should make Kevin look, sir. <n> Kevin: What?! No! W-w-why would you even say that? <n> Stu: Uh, sir, we have a situation over here. <n> Prince Nebulon: If there's a wiener on that monitor, I swear to god, Stu. <n> Stu: Something is drawing a lot of processing power. Oh, wait. No wonder. (Jerry appears on a large screen.) There's another real human in the simulator. <n> Jerry: Okay, Jerry, big pitch meeting. Make-or-break time. *trims nostril hairs while driving* You can do this. <n> Prince Nebulon: How did this happen?! Where's the Abductions Department? <n> Zigerion 2: Hey, man, Abductions just follows the acquisition order. <n> Zigerion 3: Don't put this on Acquisitions! We only acquire humans that haven't been simulated! <n> Kevin: Well, Simulations doesn't simulate anybody that's been abducted, so— <n> Prince Nebulon: Oh, I see! Oh, oh! It was no one's fault. Oh, okay. I'm sorry. Well, then, problem solved. Oh, wait no. *shouts* There's still another human in here! Who is he? <n> Stu: Rick's son-in-law, Jerry Smith. So far, he hasn't noticed he's in a simulation. <n> Prince Nebulon: *sighs* Well, cap his sector at 5% processing, keep his settings on auto, and we'll deal with him later. Rick Sanchez is the target. <n> [Trans. Jerry's car] <n> Jerry: *inhales deeply* Gotta relax. It's just a pitch. Gotta relax. <n> (He turns on the radio.) <n> Radio: This is earth radio. And now, here's…human music. <n> (Repetitive rhythmic beeping.) <n> Jerry: Hmm. Human music. I like it. *rocks head side to side in rhythm with the music* <n> [Pan out to see Jerry's sector of the simulation, followed by a transition to Rick and Morty's.] <n> (Rick and Morty pant as they run naked down the street. Rick shoves their clothes into a sewer.) <n> Morty: Rick! <n> Rick: Uhp, uhp, uhp! Morty, keep your hands off your ding-dong! It's the only way we can speak freely. Look around you, Morty. Do you really think this world is real? You'd have to be an idiot not to notice all the sloppy details. Look, that guy's putting a bun between two hot dogs. <n> Morty: I don't know, Rick. I mean, I've seen people do that before. <n> Rick: Well, look at that old lady. She's, she's walking a cat on a leash. <n> Morty: Uh, Mrs. Spencer does that all the time, Rick. <n> Rick: Look, I-I-I don't wanna hear about Mrs. Spencer, Morty! She's an idiot! Alright, alright, there. W-what about that, Morty? <n> (A Poptart walks out of a toaster house and into a toaster car before driving away.) <n> Morty: Okay, okay, you got me on that one. <n> Rick: Oh, really, Morty? Are you sure you haven't seen that somewhere in real life before? <n> Morty: No, no. I haven't seen that. I mean, why would a Poptart wanna live inside a toaster, Rick? I mean, that would be, like, the scariest place for them to live. You know what I mean? <n> Rick: You're missing the point, Morty. Why would he drive a smaller toaster with wheels? I mean, does your car look like a smaller version of your house? No. <n> Morty: So, why are they doing this? W-what do they want?  <n> Rick: Well, that would be obvious to you, Morty, if you'd been paying attention. <n> (Siren wails. Ambulance drives up to them and the doors open.) <n> Paramedic: We got the president of the United States in here! We need 10cc of concentrated dark matter, stat, or he'll die! <n> (Rick slams the ambulance doors shut and starts walking off.) <n> Morty: Concentrated dark matter! They were asking about that in class. <n> Rick: Yeah, it's a special fuel I invented to travel through space faster than anybody else. These Zigerions are always trying to scam me out of my secrets, but they made a big mistake this time, Morty. They dragged you into this. Now they're gonna pay! <n> Morty: Wait, wha, w-w-what are we gonna do? <n> Rick: We'll scam the scammers, Morty. And we're gonna take them for everything they've got. <n> [Trans. Ext.

Jerry's boss's office] <n> Jerry: Mr. Marklevitz, do you have a minute to talk? <n> Mr. Marklevitz: *snaps fingers* Yes. <n> Jerry: Look, I'm a fraud. I mean, let's face it. "Hungry for apples" is just a rip-off of "Got milk?" It's almost identical. <n> Mr. Marklevitz: *snaps fingers* Yes. <n> Jerry: Okay. I deserve that. Um, I guess I'll just pack up my desk. <n> Mr. Marklevitz: *snaps fingers* Yes. <n> Jerry: *crying* Oh my god. Wait. You know what?! No! The milk people don't have a patent on simple rhetorical questions! Y-You— There's not even a single word in "Hungry for Apples" that's shared by "Got milk?" It's a completely different slogan. It's different! And I shouldn't be fired. I should be promoted! <n> Mr. Marklevitz: *snaps fingers* Yes. <n> Jerry: Yeah! Wait. Really? <n> Mr. Marklevitz: *snaps fingers* Yes. <n> Jerry: Yes! I mean, it may be derivative, but it's the most successful campaign to come out of this agency in a long time. <n> Mr. Marklevitz: *snaps fingers* Yes. <n> Jerry: I-I'm not saying it should win an award for commercials, but it could certainly be nominated for an award for commercials specifically about apples, like an Appley or something. <n> Mr. Marklevitz: *snaps fingers* Yes. <n> Jerry: Is there really an award called the Appley for apple-related ad campaigns? <n> Mr. Marklevitz: *snaps fingers* Yes. <n> Jerry: Could we nominate me? <n> Mr. Marklevitz: *snaps fingers* Yes. <n> Jerry: Holy crap! <n> (Jerry runs out. Mr. Marklevitz glitches.) <n> [Trans. Ext. Smith house] <n> (Rick and Morty get out of the escape pod and head into the garage with the chips.) <n> Rick: Get in, Morty. I'm gonna be able to use these processors to make some real important science stuff. (Keypad beeps.) Huh. I thought I entered the code right. (Keypad beeps.) <n> (Second level simulation vanishes.) <n> Prince Nebulon: Well, what's this? W-what could this possibly be? Because it looks like you're inside a simulation…inside a simulation. You're still on the ship. Game-day bucket go boom! <n> Cynthia: Sir, the, uh, doctor's appointment to examine the discoloration on your butthole flaps was— <n> Prince Nebulon: Too loud, Cynthia. Too loud and too specific. <n> Rick: Uhh… <n> Prince Nebulon: We've known how to make concentrated dark matter for a long time. But now we also know the code to your fabled safe, Rick Sanchez! All your most valuable secrets will now be ours! <n> Rick: Uh, yeah, until I get home before you and change the combination, you bunch of idiots! <n> Prince Nebulon: That is why you're never getting home. Get them! <n> (Guards try to grab Rick and Morty. Rick pulls down Morty's pants and all the Zigerions back away in disgust.) <n> Rick: RUN MORTY! <n> (Morty pulls up his pants. They run through the spacecraft and are chased by Zigerions.) <n> Morty: Oh my god! <n> [Trans. Appley Awards] <n> Jerry: I got to tell you, this morning, I didn't even know this award existed. Now I'm holding one. And, um… Look, I want to say that today was the best day of my life But the truth is, it's, it's more meaningful than that. <n> Mailman: My man! <n> Jerry: Yes. Thank you, sir. I am finally complete! <n> (Everyone glitches into the mailman.) <n> Mailmen: My my my my man! <n> (Simulation continues glitching badly.) <n> Jerry: Aah! What the hell?! (Appley award glitches out of existence.) No. <n> (Rick and Morty run into the room.) <n> Rick: Jerry?! <n> Morty: Dad! <n> Rick: What are you doing here? W-why are you dressed like a waiter? Screw it. We don't have time. Come on. *starts dragging Jerry with them* <n> Jerry: *sobbing* No! <n> (Chase continues. The three make it onto a spaceship.) <n> Rick: Man up, Jerry! I may need you to work the lasers. <n> Morty: Oh, man! They're hot on our tail, Rick! <n> Rick: I guess they really do have concentrated dark matter. <n> Morty: Well, you know how to make it, too, right, Rick? <n> Rick: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Uh, check the engine room. We just need cesium, Plutonic quarks, and bottled water. <n> Morty: Whoa! It's all here, Rick! <n> Rick: Wow, Morty. Lucky break. Grab that bucket. Okay, two parts Plutonic quarks, one part cesium. <n> Morty: Okay. Uh-huh. Alright. <n> Rick: Now empty the water bottle into the bucket and pour it all into the fuel tank so we can get the hell out of here! What are you doing, Morty?! There's no time! <n> Morty: *freezes up* <n> Rick: Oh, no. <n> (Simulation breaks down...again.) <n> Jerry: What the…? <n> Rick: No! <n> Prince Nebulon: *laughing* Oh my god, Rick. How dumb are you? You're inside a simulation of a simulation…inside another giant simulation! *laughs harder* W-we never had the recipe for concentrated dark matter. But we do now! We do now, sucka! <n> Rick: You simulated my grandson's genitalia?! Y-y-you bunch of diabolical sons of bitches! <n> Zigerion 1: Kevin fought real hard to supervise that project. <n> Kevin: You said you weren't gonna tell anyone! I'm never gonna live this down, am I? <n> Rick: All right. Okay. All right, great. Wonderful. You win. Can we go home now? <n> Zigerion 1: I don't know. Can you? <n> Prince Nebulon: Ha! *fist bumps* Nice. Okay, okay. Show this gullible turd to his shuttle. I'm done with him. Oh, wait. Let me get a picture. *snaps a selfie of himself with Rick* Aww. Look at his face. He's trying to figure out if He's in a simulation still. Are you, Rick? Are you? *laughs, walks away* You're not. *walks back* Or are you? (Rick and Jerry leave.) *shouts after them* Oh, a-and, by the way, I don't have discolored butthole flaps. That was part of the simulation. <n> Cynthia: Oh. Uh, sir, should I cancel that appointment, then? <n> Prince Nebulon: *loudly* Yeah! Of course you should! *to Cynthia* No, keep it. Move it up, actually, if you can. <n> [Trans. Shuttle to Earth] <n> Rick: Hey, Jerry, don't worry about it. So what if the most meaningful day of your life was a simulation operating at minimum capacity? <n> Jerry: You know what, Rick? Those guys took you for a ride, too. You should try having a little respect for the dummies of the universe, now that you're one of us. <n> Rick: Maybe you're right, Jerry. Maybe you're right. <n> [Trans. Zigerion space craft, control room] <n> (The Zigerions are celebrating their victory with a party.) <n> Prince Nebulon: All right, everybody. Two parts Plutonic quarks… One part cesium…. A-and listen, I'm sorry for shouting earlier. I-I couldn't ask for a better staff. I love you guys, and I love all your families. *readies water bottle* And the final ingredient… <n> (Zigerion spacecraft explodes.) <n> [Trans. Shuttle to Earth] <n> (Jerry looks behind them, shocked.) <n> Jerry: Whoa! What the hell?! W-what happened back there? <n> Rick: Why don't you ask the smartest people in the universe, Jerry? Oh, yeah. You can't. They blew up. <n> ("Baker Street" plays. Rick vocalizes the saxophone part.) <n> [Trans. Int. Ad agency] <n> (Jerry pitches "Hungry for Apples" in reality.) <n> Jerry: So… What do you think? <n> Mr. Marklevitz: You're fired. <n> Jerry: Wha--? But t-this idea was tested in a state-of-the-art simulation. <n> Mr. Marklevitz: Well, then, it was a terrible simulation. Get out. <n> (Jerry hangs his head and leaves.) <n> Mr. Marklevitz: Man, how does a guy like that go home and have sex with his wife? <n> [Trans. Morty's bedroom] <n> Rick: Hey, Morty. <n> Morty: What? <n> Rick: Hey, little buddy. H-h-how you doing in here right now? <n> Morty: Aw, geez, Rick. What are you doing, man? <n> Rick: Y-y-you're a good kid, Morty. Y-you're a real l-little c-character, Morty. <n> Morty: Oh, boy. <n> Rick: You know, I had a really rocky road today, M-Morty. You're my little friend, aren't you? We had some good times together, huh, M-Morty? We You're a real true hero out in the field. You're a... You're a real trouper, huh, M-M-Morty? <n> Morty: Have you been drinking, Rick? <n> Rick: I really appreciate you, Morty. <n> Morty: O-okay, cool. A-alright, Rick <n> Rick: *suddenly aggressive, holds a knife to Morty's throat* You little son of a bitch! Y-y- are you a simulation?! Huh?! Are you a simulation?! <n> Morty: No! No! No! <n> Rick: You little son of a bitch! <n> Morty: *terrified, gasps* <n> (Rick lowers the knife) <n> Rick: I-I-I'm sorry, Morty. Y-you're a good… You're a good kid, Morty. <n> Morty: Geez! <n> Rick: Y-you're a good… You're a good kid. *passes out* <n> Morty: Oh my god! <n> Rick: *snores* <n> Morty: W-w-what the hell? What a life.
[Open on Morty combing his hair in the bathroom mirror. He is wearing an orange sweater vest, a yellow dress shirt, and an olive tie.] <n> Pickle Rick: (offscreen, in the distance) Morty. <n> Morty: Rick? <n> [Morty stops combing, looks around, then continues combing] <n> Pickle Rick: (offscreen, in the distance) Morty! <n> Morty: Rick? <n> Pickle Rick: (offscreen, in the distance) Hey, Mooorty! <n> Morty: Rick? Are you far away, or are you inside something? <n> [Morty opens a cabinet beneath the bathroom sink] <n> Is this a camera? <n> [Morty tries to look inside his comb for a camera] <n> Is everything a camera? <n> [Morty nervously glances around] <n> Pickle Rick: (offscreen, in the distance) Morty, the garage, Morty. Come to the garage! <n> [Transition to Morty entering the garage. There is a pickle and a screwdriver on Rick's work bench] <n> Pickle Rick: Morty? <n> Morty: Rick? W-where are you? <n> Pickle Rick: On my work bench, Morty. <n> Morty: Are you invisible and you're gonna, like, fart on me? <n> Pickle Rick: Flip the pickle over. <n> Morty: What, I'm gonna touch it, and you're gonna tell me it's an alien dick or something. <n> Pickle Rick: Come on, flip the pickle, Morty. You're not gonna regret it. The payoff is huge. <n> [Morty hesitantly picks up the screwdriver and turns the pickle over. The pickle has Rick's face on it] I turned myself into a pickle, Morty! Boom! Big reveal: I'm a pickle. What do you think about that? I turned myself into a pickle! W-what are you just staring at me for, bro. I turned myself into a pickle, Morty! <n> Morty: And? <n> Pickle Rick: "And"? What more do you want tacked on to this? I turned myself into a pickle, and 9/11 was an inside job? <n> Morty: Was it? <n> Pickle Rick: Who cares, Morty? Global acts of terrorism happen every day. Uh, here's something that's never happened before: I'm a pickle. I'm Pickle Rick! <n> Morty: Are you going to, I mean, you know, is this the first part of some magic trick? <n> Pickle Rick: I don't do magic, Morty, I do science. One takes brains, the other takes dark eye liner. <n> Morty: Well, can you move? Can you fly? <n> Pickle Rick: I wouldn't be much of a pickle if I could. <n> Morty: All right, well, do pickles live forever or -- <n> Pickle Rick: Morty, stop digging for hidden layers and just be impressed. I'm a pickle. <n> Morty: I-I'm just trying to figure out why you would do this. Why anyone would do this. <n> Pickle Rick: The reason anyone would do this is, if they could, which they can't, would be because they could, which they can't. <n> [Beth and Summer enter the garage from the house. Beth is wearing a midi mahogany pencil dress while Summer is wearing a shorter pink dress with a hot pink jacket, along with black stockings and black heels] <n> Beth: Morty, we have to get going, or we're gonna be late. Where's your grandpa? <n> Pickle Rick: Right here, sweetie. I'm a pickle! <n> Beth: What?! Why would you -- Look, we're running late. We have to go. <n> Pickle Rick: Where are you guys going? <n> Beth: We have an appointment downtown that was set a week ago and agreed upon by everyone, including you. <n> Pickle Rick: Oh, my God. Beth, oh, it totally slipped my mind. Geez, oh, man. I'm a pickle. I mean, I don't know if I can, ooh, geez. <n> Morty: Rick, did you do this on purpose to get out of family counseling? <n> Beth: Morty! <n> Pickle Rick: It's okay, Beth. I understand Morty's suspicion. I've misled him before. Morty, turn me so we're making eye contact. <n> [Morty turns Pickle Rick's face so that it is facing him] <n> Morty, I assure you, I would never "find a way" to "get out of" family therapy. I hope my lack of fingers doesn't prevent the perception of my air quotes. <n> Summer: Can't you just turn yourself back into a human? <n> Pickle Rick: Great question, Summer. The unfortunate answer is I did this to challenge myself. And it could take hours or even days before I'm able to figure out how to return to human form. But, I mean, you know, your mom could put me in a purse or a pocket, you know, if she really needs me to go. <n> Beth: Nobody needs anything! Okay, it's fine. I mean, you should just stay here and figure out how to stop being a pickle, okay? <n> Morty: Hey, Rick, why is there a syringe of mysterious fluid hanging directly over you? Also, why is the string attached to it running through a pair of scissors attached to a timer? And why is the time set to 10 minutes from now, exactly when we would have left for therapy? <n> Pickle Rick: Well, Morty, if you know must know, the syringe is completely unrelated to this discussion, and, therefore, it does not warrant further explanation. <n> [Beth cuts off the syringe and takes it] <n> Beth: Enough. Kids, it's time to go. We don't want to be late. <n> [Beth puts the syringe in her purse] <n> Pickle Rick: W-w-what are you doing there, Beth? What are you doing there, sweetie? <n> Beth: Well, I mean, you don't want to get pierced by a needle full of liquid unrelated to your situation. How's that gonna help? <n> Pickle Rick: Can't argue with that. <n> Beth: Great. We'll see you later. <n> [Beth, Summer, and Morty enter the car.] <n> Pickle Rick: Hey, hey, be careful with that. It's for something else. It's really important, so don't break it. <n> [Beth drives away with Summer and Morty. They all exit.] <n> Okay, I may have fucked up here. Dup, ap, ap, pap, ut, dah, pap, pap, pap, pah. T-t-tah, tah. [clicks tongue] <n> Izzy walks in through the open garage door and jumps onto Rick's work bench. She sniffs around] <n> Oh, great. Stupid cat. <n> [Izzy sniffs Pickle Rick and hisses] <n> Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! I know what it looks like to you, Izzy, but I'm not a snake! I've seen the YouTube videos, I know cats are scared of cucumbers and pickles because they think they're snakes. I'm not a snake! I'm a pickle, I'm a pickle! <n> [Izzy bats at Pickle Rick and knocks him off of the work bench, causing him to roll down the driveway] <n> Whoa! Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa! <n> [Pickle Rick is directly facing the sky] <n> Oh, crap, that sun is bright. <n> [Pickle Rick begins to sweat] <n> Okay, come on. This can't really be the way I go out. This is the mega-genius equivalent of dying on the toilet. <n> [Pickle Rick starts to shrivel up] <n> So... hot. This is how I'm gonna die. <n> [Thunder can be heard and the shadow of a cloud appears overhead. It starts to rain. Pickle Rick stops shriveling] <n> Oh, God, moisture. <n> [The rain gets heavy and it begins to flood] <n> Oh, God, the moisture! Dial it back, God! Dial it back a little bit here! <n> [Pickle Rick starts rolling down the road] <n> Oh! Oh! <n> [Pickle Rick rolls towards a sewer grate] <n> Oh, God! Perpendicular, perpendicular! <n> [Pickle Rick rolls into the sewer grate and falls into the sewer] <n> Oh, shiiit! Oh! Oh! Oh! <n> [Pickle Rick hits many pipes before eventually falling onto a solid surface. There are bugs crawling around. One bug walks up to a pile of dirt. Pickle Rick bites his lip and pickle juice comes out. The bug turns around] <n> Come on. That's it. <n> [The bug walks towards Pickle Rick] <n> Come get this delicious brine. <n> [The bug is in front of Pickle Rick. Pickle Rick bites on its head and squeezes it until the bug dies.] <n> Aah! Come on! Come on, motherfucker! Come on! <n> [Pickle Rick licks off the top of the bug's head, revealing its brain. He then licks part of the brain and the bug's leg moves. He rolls onto the bug and licks its brain, moving its legs forward and moving him forward with it] <n> Pickle Rick: Yes! <n> [Transition to Beth, Summer, and Morty sitting in a waiting room outside of Dr. Wong's therapy office. Beth is reading a magazine, while Summer sits with her head resting on her fist. The door to her office reads: "Dr. WONG / FAMILY THERAPY / COPROPHRAGIA RECOVERY". There is a motivational picture of a man eating a hot dog which reads "COURAGE" underneath it.] <n> Summer: How is this even family therapy if Dad's not invited and Grandpa won't come? <n> Morty: Yeah, and what's courageous about eating a hot dog? <n> Beth: It's nobody's choice to be here, you knobs. The family was told to get counseling by your principal, even though it's not the family that was huffing pottery glaze in the art room and desk wetting in history class. <n> Mr. Goldenfold enters through Dr. Wong's door. <n> Mr. Goldenfold: Oh, the Smith family, minus a dad. You're patients of Dr. Wong, too? <n> Beth: Temporarily. By order of the school. <n> Mr. Goldenfold: Me too. How long have you all been eating poop? <n> Summer: We... have never... eaten poop. <n> Mr. Goldenfold: Uh, me, neither. Say, where did my family get off to? <n> [Mr. Goldenfold exits. Dr. Wong opens her door and enters the waiting room] <n> Dr. Wong: Smith family, I'm Dr. Wong. Come on in. <n> [Beth, Summer, and Morty exit the waiting room and enter Dr. Wong's office. Dr. Wong flips the motivational image over to another motivational image of a nuclear family which reads "DEDICATION". Transition to Beth, Morty, Summer, and Dr. Wong sitting down in Dr. Wong's office.] <n> Dr. Wong: I was told there was a grandpa that might be joining us? <n> Beth: He got wrapped up in an experiment. He's a scientist. Like, legit, like on an inter-galactic, sci-fi level. His work is very -- <n> Morty: He turned himself into a pickle. <n> Beth: Morty, Mom's talking. I'm sorry, I suppose that's a good segue into our little discipline cases here. <n> Dr. Wong: Does Grandpa turn himself into a pickle a lot? <n> Beth: What? No, what kind of question is that? <n> Dr. Wong: The kind that wasn't designed to attack or hurt you in any way. <n> Beth: Oh, Jesus Christ, one of these. No, my father has never turned himself into a pickle before. He's unpredictable and eccentric. The whole family is. Speaking of which... <n> [Beth turns towards Summer and Morty] <n> Dr. Wong: Okay, let's open things up to the whole family, and let me ask this. Why do we think Grandpa turned himself into a pickle? <n> [Beth rolls her eyes. Transition to Pickle Rick, who has attached the bug's limbs to his pickle body and has managed to use them to move. He is looking through a grate, and is rubbing the end of one of the bug arms against one of the bars] <n> Pickle Rick: Wow. Ugh. <n> [A rat appears behind the grate and starts scratching at Pickle Rick, screeching] <n> Hey, listen, I know this is your world not mine. The sooner I can get out, the sooner I can go back to taking big craps, and you can go back to subsisting on them. <n> [The rat breaks open one of the bars and continues to scratch. Pickle Rick starts to walk backwards.] <n> You are one driven rat. Could you be a little more driven? To the right. <n> [Pickle Rick scratches at a rope which is attached to a bug's arms which is holding a razor that it lets go of which is propelled upwards which breaks a rubber band which is tied to a sharp broken bottle which falls on the rat's head and chops it off, killing the rat] <n> [Pickle Rick picks up the rat's head] <n> Yes, yes, yes! Come on, come on, come on! <n> Fresh, fresh, fresh! <n> [A mischief of rats appears behind the bars, also scratching at Pickle Rick, who is not in their range.] <n> Whoa, whoa, whoa, was this your friend? Don't worry, he died doing what he loved, being a dumb fucking rat. <n> [Pickle Rick puts the rat's head onto a bottle cap which starts a machine which lifts him up and takes off his bug limbs. The machine then splits open the rat head and rips out its brain, then puts Pickle Rick down and begins nailing the rat's body parts to Pickle Rick's pickle body. It then sticks a needle into the brain which connects it to the limbs. Pickle Rick runs towards the rats and begins killing them.] <n> Oh, yeah! Aaaah! <n> [He takes out a machines on his wrists which are loaded with screws. He kills some of the rats. The screws disappear and x-acto blade pop out. He kills more rats. Transition to Dr. Wong's office.] <n> Beth: I didn't say my father is perfect, I said his work is important. <n> Summer: And she's saying what's important is that Grandpa lied to you to get out of coming here. <n> Beth: Oh, he did not! <n> Dr. Wong: Let's do an experiment here. I get the impression this family values science. So raise your hand if you feel certain you know what was in the syringe. <n> [No one raises their hand.] <n> Raise your hand if you know for certain the syringe does not contain anti-pickle serum. <n> [Beth begins to raise her hand but stops herself.] <n> Beth, your hand did a little thing there. <n> Beth: Do you really not see what's happening here? <n> Dr. Wong: Tell me. <n> Beth: Well, Dr. Wong -- by the way, racist name -- obviously, Morty and Summer are seizing on your arbitrary pickle obsession as an end run around what was supposed to be their therapy. <n> Dr. Wong: Oh, I think this pickle incident is a better path than any other to the heart of your family's dysfunction. I think it's possible that you and your father have a very specific dynamic. I don't think it's one that rewards emotion or vulnerability. I think it may punish them. I think it's possible that dynamic eroded your marriage, and is infecting your kids with a tendency to misdirect their feelings. <n> [A short pause] <n> Beth: Fuck you. <n> Morty and Summer, in unison: Mom! <n> Beth: Fuck both of you, too. <n> [Transition to Pickle Rick, fighting a much larger grey rat and beating it up.] <n> Pickle Rick: By the way, you might notice that in spite of your numerous distinctive features, I never gave you a name like Scar or Stripe or Goliath. That's because, to me, you aren't special. <n> [Pickle Rick pins the rat to the wall with some screws.] <n> You were special to rats. Now they're dead. I guess it was me you should have impressed. <n> [Pickle Rick slices open the rat's stomach with his x-acto blade.] <n> God damn it, I love myself. <n> [Pickle Rick walks up to a pipe above him. His wrist machines fall off and are replaced with a jet pack. He pulls a hood over his head with a rat's face on it. He turns on the jet pack and flies out of the pipe and out of a toilet.] <n> Pickle Riiick! <n> [Pickle Rick opens the door. It is a bathroom door with a "male" sign on the front. He starts running around and opening various doors and looking in. Eventually he runs up to an elevator and tries to jump up to the buttons but cannot reach them. He tries to scale the wall but fails. He pushes a garbage can and a potted plant next to each other in front of the elevator buttons. He jumps off of the garbage can into the potted plant, then jumps into the lid which turns rapidly and propels him up and swings him to the elevator buttons.] <n> Get that parkour. Get that parkour! <n> [Pickle Rick kicks the "down button", then waits on the ground for the elevator. The elevator opens, and three men in black suits with earpieces stand inside. They notice Pickle Rick and gasp.] <n> Hey, it's cool. Just need to find the nearest exit. <n> [The men in the elevator point their guns at Pickle Rick.] <n> Whoa, whoa, whoa! No need to freak out. <n> [One of the men yells something in a foreign language into his earpiece and all three men start shooting at him. He runs away and they chase after him, still shooting at him.] <n> Whoa! Who in the fuck's toilet is this? <n> [Transition to the frontal exterior of the building. It is a rather large light brown building with a stone fence and a plethora of guards surrounding it. An alarm blares. Some guards run around to the other side of the building's roof. Transition to a surveillance room where the three agents from the elevator are waiting. The Agency Director slams open the door.] <n> Agency Director: What is it? <n> Agent #1: A pickle. A rat. Both. <n> Agent #2: It says it's a scientist. <n> Agency Director: Where is it? <n> Agent #1: It seems to be using the air ducts and the mail tubes to get around. <n> [A monitor shows Pickle Rick climbing into an air duct] <n> It's been gathering office supplies, we think, to build weaponry. But look what it did on the mezzanine. <n> [The monitor shows Pickle Rick jumping from a potted plant to the trash can to the recycling bin] <n> It transferred a bottle from the trash to the recycling bin. <n> [On the monitor, Pickle Rick picks up a glass bottle from the trash can, taunts the camera with it, throws it in the recycling bin, then runs off.] <n> Whatever this thing is, it's shaming us. <n> Agency Director: We have 34 armed guards, and we can't kill a pickle? <n> Agent #1: 32 armed guards. He killed two. <n> Agent #2: It's on the phone. <n> [A phone rings and one of the monitors reads "INCOMING CALL".] <n> Agency Director: Put him on, and locate the phone he's using. <n> [Agent #2 picks up the phone] <n> Hello. <n> Pickle Rick: Hi, um, can you, uh (burps) please let me out. <n> Agency Director: Your mere presence in this building violates international law. <n> [Agent #1 walks up to the Agency Director with a clipboard, which reads "LEVEL 3 / ROOM 304" in red pen. He taps the clipboard. The Agency Director looks at it and nods.] <n> I couldn't let you out even if you hadn't killed two men. <n> [Transition to Pickle Rick. The bottom part of the phone he is using has been dismantled. He attaches a belt around his waist which has batteries in the back of it. <n> Pickle Rick: You should know those men killed themselves. <n> Agency Director: And how is that? <n> Pickle Rick: They didn't (burps) let me out. <n> Agent #2 Solen'ya. <n> Agency Director: Shut your mouth and do your jobs, you fucking children! <n> Pickle Rick: Uh, is this not a good time or...? <n> [Agent #1 holds his earpiece up to his ear. He gives a thumbs up to the Agency Director. On one of the monitors, six agents run up to the door of room 304 with rifles.] <n> Agency Director: Some of my men are calling you "Solen'ya": The Pickle Man, an old wives tale. He crawls from bowls of cold soup to steal the dreams of wasteful children. <n> [One of the agents on the monitor gives a thumbs up. The Agency Director pantomimes slicing his neck to Agent #1.] <n> Pickle Rick: That'd be a lucky break for you. <n> Agent #1: Go, shoot to kill! <n> [Transition to room 304. One of the agents slams open the door, knocking over a water jug above the door which activates a pulley which pulls a string which cuts another string which swings a needle towards the agent's head, killing him instantly. Two more agents enter and start to walk in, but fall through the floor onto some spikes, which kill them. The three remaining agents walk in and see this and begin shooting at a pickle which is not Pickle Rick, but a decoy. They continue to shoot at the pickle until it is completely gone.] <n> Agent #3: Aaah! We got him. <n> [Transition back to the surveillance room.] <n> Agency Director: Ah. <n> Agent #1: Ah. <n> [Transition back to room 304. Agent #3 turns a computer around with the tip of his gun, whose screen reads "Receiving Call / (internet line)".] <n> Pickle Rick: ...because this pickle doesn't care about your children. And I'm not gonna take their dreams. I'm gonna take their parents. <n> [Pickle Rick steps on a laptop mouse whose screen reads "Sending Call". The window which reads that is minimized and another window is pulled up which reads "Sending Explosion / ...". Transition to room 304. The computer screen now reads "Receiving Explosion / (internet line)". The laptop blows up and the three agents are sent flying. Pickle Rick jumps out of an air duct into the hallway where the three agents are, holding a device he constructed. He holds up the device and a laser comes out, which burns a hole through all three of the men's heads, killing them instantly. Three more agents come from around the corner. Pickle Rick reloads the device and shoots another laser, this time chopping off the three other agents' ankles with it. He runs away. Transition to the surveillance room. Pickle Rick shows up on each of the monitors, and turns them off as he appears on them.] <n> Agent #2: Solen'ya! He's coming! It's because I threw half-way my sandwich! <n> Agency Director: He's just a pickle! <n> Agent #2: He's a monster! <n> Agency Director: He's not the only one. <n> [The agency director straightens his tie. Transition to another door. The agency director uses a key card to open the door, which leads to another metal door with two guards standing next to it. He turns the wheel on the door, opening it. Jaguar sits inside.] <n> You can stay, dead to the world and die in this room. Or you can kill a pickle for me and earn your freedom. <n> Jaguar: There is no freedom while your leader breathes. Our country is a prison. <n> Agency Director: Then Katarina is a prisoner. Perhaps I could arrange her escape, as well. She lives, Jaguar. <n> Jaguar: Where is this pickle? <n> [Transition to Dr. Wong's office.] <n> Dr. Wong: What do you think is in the syringe, Beth? <n> Beth: You're the one that costs $200 an hour. You tell me. <n> Morty and Summer: Anti-pickle serum. <n> Dr. Wong: Your kids think it might be anti-pickle serum. <n> Beth: My kids pee their desks and suck on unbaked vases. <n> [Morty picks up a book which sits on Dr. Wong's coffee table, which he opens and reads] <n> They're just angry at me for divorcing their father. <n> Summer: I never said I was angry at you. <n> Beth: That's the point of pottery-enamel huffing, Summer. You do it so you don't have to say "I'm angry at mommy" out loud. <n> Morty: Oh, my God! <n> [Morty closes the book and puts it back on the coffee table, pointing at it] <n> Oh, there-there's pictures of people eating poop in there! <n> [Dr. Wong picks the book up and puts it on her lap] <n> Dr. Wong: It's not my job to take sides or pass judgment. Do you think when your father asks for that syringe, you could ask him -- <n> Beth: He won't have to ask for it, okay? He won't need it. He'll just make more. He doesn't need anything from anyone. <n> Dr. Wong: You admire him for that. <n> Beth: It's better than making your problems other people's problems. <n> [Transition to Pickle Rick and Jaguar fighting in an office. Pickle Rick tries to shoot Jaguar with his laser while Jaguar tries to shoot at Pickle Rick with two guns. A bullet hits Pickle Rick and takes a small chunk out of him.] <n> Pickle Rick: Oh, come on! <n> [Pickle Rick hits Jaguar's shoulder with the laser, Pickle Rick hides behind a shelf while Jaguar hides behind a desk] <n> Jaguar: Pickle Man, you should know this isn't personal! <n> [Jaguar bites a bullet, and pours the gunpowder into a coffee filter] <n> Pickle Rick: You should know that isn't original. <n> [Pickle Rick kicks open a Styrofoam container with a burger inside and pulls it towards him] <n> They have my daughter. <n> [Jaguar takes a water bottle and pours the water into his open wound] <n> There's nothing I won't do to see her again. <n> Pickle Rick: Yeah, there's lots I wouldn't do to see my daughter, but killing you gets me to her quicker than your derivative bullshit. <n> [Pickle Rick takes a tomato slice out of the burger and squeezes it onto his missing chunk. He pulls out a packet of mustard and bites it open. Jaguar pours the gunpowder into his wound and winces. Pickle Rick rubs mustard on his missing chunk and shouts, squeezing open the mustard packet. Jaguar lights a match and puts it up to the wound, setting it on fire. Pickle Rick grabs a stapler and staples a pickle slice to his missing chunk. Both shout in unison] <n> Jaguar: I never bullshit, Pickle Man. This can only end with one of us dead, and I have never died. <n> Pickle Rick: That will be your downfall, Jaguar, not being open to new experiences. <n> [Transition to surveillance room. The two continue fighting. Pickle Rick's laser gradually takes out all of the cameras] <n> Agency Direcotr: Is it done? Jaguar?! <n> Pickle Rick: Jaguar couldn't make it. <n> Agency Director: Do it. <n> Okay, you win, Pickle Man. <n> I'm unsealing the building. <n> Pickle Rick: No, thanks. <n> I'm coming for you now. <n> Agency Director: Pickle Man, there's $100 million worth of bonds in a safe on level two. <n> I'll give you the combination. <n> Agent #2: That money belongs to the people. <n> Agency Director: Shut up and call me a helicopter, you prick! Do we have a deal?! <n> Pickle Rick: Take that money, give it to Jaguar's daughter when you set her free. <n> Or I'll be visiting you. <n> Agency Director: Jaguar's daughter is dead. <n> Pickle Rick: Huh, so you're a liar. <n> Agency Director: Jaguar was an animal. <n> You're an intelligent pickle. <n> We can do business. <n> Pickle Rick: I don't think so. <n> See you soon. <n> Agency Director: Is the helicopter here? <n> Agent #2: Yes. <n> And the police are on the way. <n> What do we tell them? <n> [The Director kills both agents with headshots.] <n> Agency Director: Tell them we were robbed. <n> [The Director fills a duffel bag with documents and passports and run to the helicopter on the roof, which takes off without him] <n> Hey! Hey, what are you doing?! I'm right here! <n> [The shot pans to show the helicopter is being flown by Jaguar, with Pickle Rick in the passenger bay. Pickle Rick takes a drag on a cigarette and throws it into a pile of oil on the roof, igniting it into a half-ring behind the Director. The flames also ignite a fuse leading to a cache of explosives inside the building] <n> Agency Director: Farewell, Solen'ya. <n> Jaguar: F-15s are scrambled. This helicopter will be shot down in seven minutes. <n> Pickle Rick: Well, my daughter is about five away, and I've got about eight to live. <n> Jaguar: Pickle Man, it's too late for me to tell my daughter I love her, but not for you. <n> Pickle Rick: Oh, well, uh, she knows. <n> I mean, we don't really buy into that kind of crap, to the extent that love is an expression of familiarity over time, my access to infinite timelines precludes the necessity of attachment. <n> In fact, I even abandoned one of my infinite daughters in an alternate version of earth that was taken over by mutants. <n> Jaguar: Okay. <n> Good luck with that. <n> Wait. <n> Do I have infinite daughters? <n> Pickle Rick: Huh? Uh, no. <n> No, nope, sorry about that. <n> Nope, just me. <n> Yeesh! <n> [Transition to Dr. Wong's office.] <n> Beth: I am afraid that my kids will get expelled. <n> Dr. Wong: Good. <n> Summer, you go. <n> Summer: I am mad that I can't huff enamel without people assuming it's because my family sucks. <n> I hope to be seen one day as someone that just likes getting high. <n> Dr. Wong: Good job. <n> Morty, do you have an "I" statement? <n> Morty: I am sad that I peed. I'm sad that I peed in class instead of a toilet. <n> Dr. Wong: Look at this family go. <n> You guys are pros. <n> What do you guys think about doing this once a week? <n> [The door bursts open from Pickle Rick's kick.] <n> Pickle Rick: Ugh. <n> [Pickle Rick walks in and flops on the couch next to Summer.] <n> Dr. Wong: You must be Rick. <n> Pickle Rick: Mm-hmm. <n> Dr. Wong: I've heard a lot about you today. <n> Your family is crazy about you. <n> Your daughter holds you in very high regard. <n> You're a lucky fella. <n> Pickle Rick: Yeah, thank you. <n> Uh, sweetie, you don't still happen to have that syringe in your purse? <n> [Beth looks to Dr. Wong, who nods at her to proceed. Beth looks back at Pickle Rick.] <n> Beth: Dad I would like you to tell me what's in the syringe. <n> Pickle Rick: It's a serum that I need to, uh, to stay alive. <n> I have had a rough day. <n> And, uh, I've sustained a lot of damage. <n> I'm pretty close to death, which the serum will prevent. <n> Dr. Wong: By changing you from a pickle to a human. <n> Pickle Rick: Yes. <n> Dr. Wong: Rick, why did you lie to your daughter? <n> Pickle Rick: So I wouldn't have to come here. <n> Dr. Wong: Why didn't you want to come here? <n> Pickle Rick: Because I don't respect therapy, because I'm a scientist. Because I invent, transform, create, and destroy for a living, and when I don't like something about the world, I change it. And I don't think going to a rented office in a strip mall to listen to some agent of averageness explain which words mean which feelings has ever helped anyone do anything. <n> I think it's helped a lot of people get comfortable and stop panicking, which is a state of mind we value in the animals we eat, but not something I want for myself. I'm not a cow. I'm a pickle. When I feel like it. So...you asked. <n> Dr. Wong: Rick, the only connection between your unquestionable intelligence and the sickness destroying your family is that everyone in your family, you included, use intelligence to justify sickness. <n> You seem to alternate between viewing your own mind as an unstoppable force and as an inescapable curse. And I think it's because the only truly unapproachable concept for you is that it's your mind within your control. You chose to come here, you chose to talk -to belittle my vocation- just as you chose to become a pickle. <n> You are the master of your universe, and yet you are dripping with rat blood and feces. Your enormous mind literally vegetating by your own hand. <n> I have no doubt that you would be bored senseless by therapy, the same way I'm bored when I brush my teeth and wipe my ass. Because the thing about repairing, maintaining, and cleaning is it's not an adventure. There's no way to do it so wrong you might die. It's just work. And the bottom line is, some people are okay going to work, and some people well, some people would rather die. <n> Each of us gets to choose. <n> [After a few silent beats, Dr. Wong's watch beeps.] <n> That's our time. I'm going to give you guys my card and hope to hear from you again. <n> And if you have any friends or family that eat poop and would like to stop, give them my number. <n> [Transition to Beth's car. Beth is driving; Pickle Rick is buckled into the front passenger seat; Summer and Morty are in the back bench seat.] <n> Pickle Rick: I, um I'm sorry I lied to get out of the thing. <n> I, I shouldn't lie to you. <n> Beth: Oh, it's fine. <n> I mean, thank you, and, yeah, you shouldn't. <n> But I hope you know that's not what that session was supposed to be. <n> Pickle Rick: Oh, no, I mean, I know it was Morty peeing his pants and Summer snorting glue or whatever... <n> Beth: [Laughs] She huffed enamel, and we never even talked about it. <n> Pickle Rick: Well, there was so much more at stake. I mean, that shrink, what a monologuist. <n> Summer: Are we gonna go back? <n> Pickle Rick: Sweetie, could I get Get that syringe now? <n> Beth: Oh, my God, yes! Dad, it's in my purse. <n> Oh, I'm sorry. <n> You must be in agony. <n> Pickle Rick: Eh. <n> [Rick injects himself and transforms back into a human, coughing up what looks to be pickle brine.] <n> Jesus. <n> Jesus Christ. <n> Therapists, man. <n> Beth: Weird breed. <n> Rick: Man, I missed having hands and blood and a stomach. <n> [To Beth:] We should get a drink. <n> Beth: Really? Like, go somewhere? Yeah, let's drop the kids off and go tie one on. <n> Rick: Absolutely. <n> Morty: I, I liked her. <n> Beth: So what are you thinking, like, Smokey's Tavern? Maybe Shoney's? <n> Rick: Yeah, either one. Either one. <n> [Post credits. Transition to Concerto's death trap piano. Rick and Morty are tied up beneath giant piano keys, with other corpses--their heads smashed in--lay to either side of them, while Concerto is perched above them on a smaller piano that controls the death trap.] <n> Rick: You'll never get away with this, Concerto. <n> Concerto: That is where you're mistaken, Mr. Sanchez. <n> This shall be my greatest performance of all time! <n> [Concerto starts playing his piano, forcing some of the giant keys to strike the already smashed heads of the corpses.] <n> Rick: This is it, Morty. <n> We're goners. <n> We're not getting out of this one. <n> After everything we've been through, this is how we're gonna die. <n> Make peace with your god. <n> Morty: Oh, geez, Rick, I-I-I don't want to die! <n> Concerto: And now for the E-splat! <n> [Jaguar glides in and slits Concerto's throat.] <n> Rick: Jaguar! <n> [Jaguar looks back to Rick, nods slightly, then extends his flight suit's wings and flies off.] <n> Morty: Who? Who was that, Rick? <n> Rick: That, Morty, is why you don't go to therapy
